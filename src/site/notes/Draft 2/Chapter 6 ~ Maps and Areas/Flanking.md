[[Character\|Characters]] can position themselves such that they make it difficult for the defending Character to protect themselves. [[Character\|Characters]] flanking a defending Character gain a [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] against the defending Character for melee [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Attack\|Attacks]].

When two [[Character\|Characters]] are attacking a defending Character within 1 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tile]] range, draw a line between the two attacking [[Character\|Characters]]. If that line intersects the defending character, the attacking [[Character\|Characters]] are flanking the defending character. 

A Character cannot flank a defending Character that is 2 or more [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Sizes\|Sizes]] larger than them.

A Character cannot flank a single Character more than once. Even if there are multiple attacking [[Character\|Characters]] that would be considered flanking.
