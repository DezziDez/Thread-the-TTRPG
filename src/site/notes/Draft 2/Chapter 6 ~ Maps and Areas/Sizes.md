Every Character has a size. The size of a Character determines the number of [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]] they take up on a map and in physical space.

A Character increases by 1 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|tile]] for every size category above Medium and decreases by 1/2 a [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|tile]] for every category below Medium. There is no hard limit to how large or small a Character can be, but practically [[Character\|Characters]] can be too small or too large to manage for the game.

The names of the sizes beyond Small, Medium, and Large have no real meaning and can easily be changed.
