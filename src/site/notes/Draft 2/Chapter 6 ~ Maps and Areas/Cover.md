[[Character\|Characters]] can take cover behind objects to protect themselves. The cover itself though can take the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Damage\|Damage]] and once the cover is destroyed the protection is gone.

#### Full Cover
The Character is sufficiently covered to not be targeted or directly seen within line of sight.
Areas of Effect that do not [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] around corners cannot hit the Character.

#### Half Cover
At least half of the Character is covered
[[Character\|Characters]] targeting the partially covered Character suffer a [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Boon and Bane\|Bane]].
