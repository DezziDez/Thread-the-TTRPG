Some [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Items\|Item]] [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Properties\|Properties]] or [[Draft 2/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] have areas of effect (AOE). These areas are defined as follows:
### Radius Sphere
A Radius Sphere is a sphere or bubble that is defined by a center point and a radius (a radius being half the diameter, or the distance across the sphere).

Once a center point and a radius is determined. The sphere can be created by counting the number of [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Steps\|Steps]] out from the center point tile, not counting the center point tile itself.

Example, "The explosion is a 3 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Steps\|Steps]] radius sphere from the center point." 

This would create a sphere from a center point tile, that has 3 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Steps\|Steps]] of distance from the perimeter. This does mean that the diameter of a sphere is always odd numbered and contains a center.
### Projected Line
A Projected Line is a line with a distance from a chosen point and a radius of the line. The radius is defined from the center of the line because a projected line is really a cylinder.

If the projected line starts at a character, The starting point would start inside of the [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Steps\|tile]] the Character occupies.

Example, "The laser beam has a projected line of 5 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Steps\|Steps]] with a 1 tile radius."

This would create a 5 tile line that would be a 1 tile radius from the line in a cylinder. Looking at the line from the top, it would take up 2 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Steps\|Steps]] in all directions and be 5 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Steps\|Steps]] long.
