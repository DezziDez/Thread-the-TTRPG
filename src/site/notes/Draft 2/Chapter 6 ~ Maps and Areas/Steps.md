Steps in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] represent small distances in the world. Steps can be represented with [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Ranges\|Ranges]] or exact distance on a square or hex based grid.

For all relative calculations that thread makes, steps are treated as equivalent to 1 meter or 3 feet. Though, a step can represent any distance.
