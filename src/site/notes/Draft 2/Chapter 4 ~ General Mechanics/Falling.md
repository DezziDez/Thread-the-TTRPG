#### Fall Damage
If a Character falls more than 1 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tile]] then that Character would take [[Physical\|Physical]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]] equal to twice the number of [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]] they fell.

#### Hang Time
If a Character were to fall outside of their turn, they do not fall until after the beginning of their [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]]. The Character has 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] to prevent themselves from falling.
If that Character cannot prevent themselves from falling, they fall 100 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]] and can continue with the rest of their [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]]. If the Character is still falling by the end of their [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]], they fall 400 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]].
