A Character may gain an Boon or suffer a Bane in certain situations or through certain skills.
### Boon
When a Character has Boon on a roll, they choose the smallest [[Dice\|Die]] of that roll and set its value to the highest possible number. For example, if a Character rolls 1d8 and 1d4, they would roll 1d8 and add 4 instead of rolling the 1d4. If there are two Boons, both [[Dice\|Dice]] are set to their maximum values.
### Bane
If a Character has Bane on a roll, they choose the smallest [[Dice\|Die]] of that roll and set its value to 1. For example, if a Character rolls 1d8 and 1d4, they would roll 1d8 and add 1 instead of rolling the 1d4. If there are two Banes, both [[Dice\|Dice]] are set to 1.
#### Both
When a Character has both an Boon and a Bane on a roll, they cancel each other out. However, more Boons or Banes can still be applied afterwards.
