If a Character cannot be seen and another Character is not aware of where they are, then that Character is considered Hidden from the other character.

If another Character is Hidden, then as long as the Character remains hidden, then the Character that is not aware of the Hidden Character cannot local them without actively searching.

Additionally, A Hidden Character has a [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] against other [[Character\|Characters]] not aware of them.
