If another Character wishes to ride another or be carried by another character. That Character must be at least 1 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Sizes\|size]] smaller than the Character being ridden.

If multiple [[Character\|Characters]] wish to ride another, then the ridden Character must be 1 size larger for each additional Character of the same [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Sizes\|size]].

For example, if a Character is Huge, then they can carry 2 Medium [[Character\|Characters]].

Depending on the Character being ridden, they may be considered a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Companions\|companion]] such as a horse. Though more intelligent [[Character\|Characters]] may be independent and would have their own turns.

[[Character\|Characters]] riding another Character do not consume movement when the ridden Character moves.
