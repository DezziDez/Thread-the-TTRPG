Refresh: None

Effects:
Whenever you take the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Attack\|Attack]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] without a [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Item Property Lists/Basic Properties/Weapon\|Weapon]] you may add your Will [[Dice\|Die]] to your [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]]. The resulting [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Attack\|Attack]] would be [[Might+Will\|Might+Will]] instead of just Might.
