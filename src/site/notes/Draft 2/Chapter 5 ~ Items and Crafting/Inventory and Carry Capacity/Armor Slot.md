Some [[Character\|Characters]] want to wear Armor. As long as the Character meets the requirement for that armor, it will go into that character's armor slot.

A character's armor [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Slots\|Slot]] represents the character's entire body worth of armor. And a Character cannot wear more armor than is reasonable. An example being a Character wearing two sets of boots.
