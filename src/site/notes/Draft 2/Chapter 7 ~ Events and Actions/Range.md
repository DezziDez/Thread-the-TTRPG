When a Character takes the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Attack\|Attack]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] they must determine if they are within Range.

An attacking Character is within range depending on the maximum range of the [[Draft 2/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|skill]] or [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Item Property Lists/Basic Properties/Weapon\|Weapon]] being used. The [[GM\|GM]] may allow the Character to attack outside of this maximum range in certain situations or with an [[Ability Checks\|ability check]] to succeed.
