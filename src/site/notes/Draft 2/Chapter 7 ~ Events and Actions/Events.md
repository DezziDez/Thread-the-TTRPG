An event is anything that might need careful planning or swift [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|Action]] by the [[Character\|Characters]] involved. An event is broken down into [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Rounds\|Rounds]] and the length of an event is only as long as the number of [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Rounds\|Rounds]] it takes before the event ends.

Common events are combat, timed challenges/puzzles, complex social encounters, or dangerous environments.

An event can be declared by the [[GM\|GM]] at any time for any reason.
