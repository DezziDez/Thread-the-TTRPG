Every Character can perform 1 free [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] without any cost. A free [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] is a very quick and low-energy task.

If a Character wishes to perform more than 1 free [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] in a round, they must expend 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] point for every extra free [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] to do so.


## Example Free Actions
- [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Equipped\|Equipping]] or Unequipping an [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Items\|Item]].
- Studying another Character to gain information.
- Taking a [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions#Step\|Step]]. (This also triggers a step allowing you to [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] 2 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|tiles]] total)
- Using an [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Items\|item]] or object in the environment or that is [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Equipped\|Equipped]].
- Reloading a ranged [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Item Property Lists/Basic Properties/Weapon\|Weapon]].
