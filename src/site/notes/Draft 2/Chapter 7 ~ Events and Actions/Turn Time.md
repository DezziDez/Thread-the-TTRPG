In [[Thread\|Thread]], there is a concept known as Turn Time. This is where most crucial time-sensitive [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] occur. Turn Time can be entered at any time by the [[GM\|GM]] declaring an [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Events\|event]].

When an [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Events\|event]] is declared time slows into [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turns]] and [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Rounds\|Rounds]]. All [[Players1\|Players1]] vote to decide which Character goes first. After that Character ends their turn, the [[Players1\|player]] or [[GM\|GM]] controlling that Character chooses which Character goes next. Each Character can only be given 1 turn each [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Rounds\|Round]]. This then continues until all [[Character\|Characters]] in the [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Events\|event]] have had 1 turn. 

Once the last Character of the [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Rounds\|round]] finishes their turn, the beginning of the next round starts, and all [[Players1\|Players1]] vote on the Character that goes first on the new [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Rounds\|round]].

### Hidden Characters
If there are characters in an [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Events\|event]] that the [[Players1\|Players1]] are not aware of or is hidden, then the [[GM\|GM]] may choose for one of those [[Character\|characters]] to go instead of the Character the [[Players1\|Players1]] vote on if a vote takes place.
