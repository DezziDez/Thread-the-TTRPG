## Cost
All actions have a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] cost. This cost represents how much energy it takes to use that action.

All [[Character\|Characters]] can perform basic [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|Actions]] and [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Free Actions\|Free Actions]]. 
All basic [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|Actions]] cost 3 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] points when used.
## Step
When a Character performs any action, unless otherwise specified, they are allowed to move 1 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|tile]] in any direction they can access. This movement is called a step and can be taken before or after the [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|Action]] itself. Steps are not restricted by the [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Slowed\|Slowed]] [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Conditions\|condition]] unless the character's [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Speed\|Speed]] is 0.
