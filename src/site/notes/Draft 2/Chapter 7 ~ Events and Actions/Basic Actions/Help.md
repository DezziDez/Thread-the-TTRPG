### Description
A Character can provide aid to a roll to make the roll more likely to succeed or be more effective instead of making more than one roll. 

#### Using help
- The Character helps one other Character with their next roll. The other Character then gains a [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] on that roll.
- A Character cannot gain a [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] from the Help [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|action]] more than once in a roll.
- Using the Help [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|action]] on any Character with the [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition also removes 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition from the character. The Help [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|Action]] may be used multiple times to remove multiple ranks of the [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Conditions\|Condition]] on characters.

### Notes
Help can be given on any roll as long as the circumstances make sense and the Character can actually help.
