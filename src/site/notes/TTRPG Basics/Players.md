The Players are the people at the table making the dice roll. They are the ones controlling the main [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] in the story. Using the rules in [[Thread\|Thread]] after changes from the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]], the players make choices for their [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] and make a fun story.
