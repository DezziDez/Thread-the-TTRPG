GM or Game Master is the one who sets everything up. They make choices for the setting, the game, [[TTRPG Basics/NPC\|NPCs]], and any other choice that isn't made by [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|Players]].

The GM is a practically the most important role in [[Thread\|Thread]] because without a GM the game cannot exist.

The GM makes all the final choices, including and definitely not limited to, what rules to use, what rules not to use, and if a rule should be changed or not. In [[Thread\|Thread]] there are no hard and fast rules. Instead, this system is built on a foundation of trust and respect between the GM and the [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|Players]] to make the most fun game that can be made.
