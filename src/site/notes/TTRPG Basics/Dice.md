Thread uses polyhedral dice that have many different numbered sides. These dice can be found in many other games as well as game stores, book stores, and in online shops.

In Thread, dice are often referenced with d and then the number of sides on the dice. The dice used in Thread are the d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and extremely rarely, the d20.
