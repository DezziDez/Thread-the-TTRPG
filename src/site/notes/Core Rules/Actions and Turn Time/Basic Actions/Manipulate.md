### Description
Manipulation is used to use force to [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] objects or other [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]].

#### Using Manipulate
- A [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] selects an object or [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] that is not more than 1 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Sizes\|size]] larger than themselves to move. 
- The [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] requires at least 1 free [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Equipped\|Equipped]] [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Slots\|Slot]] / hand.
- The [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] makes a Might+Might check against the object or as a contest against the other character.
- Successfully moving the object or [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] moves them 1 tile in any direction.

### Notes
Using manipulate to [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] down can force a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] to become [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Prone\|Prone]].
