#### Using Attack
A [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] that takes the attack [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|action]] performs one of the following:
- The [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] attacks with a [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Item Property Lists/Basic Properties/Weapon\|Weapon]] within [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Range\|Range]]. Dealing [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] based on a roll of the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Abilities\|Ability]] for the weapon plus the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] die of the weapon.
	- For example: A [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] with rank 3 Might using a Might weapon that had a d4 [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] die, would deal 1d6+1d4 [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]].
- The [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] attacks without a weapon. All [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] can use Might to attack without a weapon. Dealing just the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] die of their Might [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Abilities\|ability]].
	- For example: A [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] with rank 3 Might attacking with their bare hands would deal 1d6 [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]].

#### Finish the Dying
Using the Attack [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|action]] on a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] with the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]] and that attack would have reduced their [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Hit Points\|Hit Points]]. The number of ranks of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition are doubled.
