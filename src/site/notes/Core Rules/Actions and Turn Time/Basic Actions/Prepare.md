### Description
Prepare is a strategistic [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Action]] that allows for better [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] management. It also helps with setup and planning outside of normal turns.

#### When Used
- The player must declare their next quick action.
- The [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character's]] turn ends.
- The [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] cost of the next [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Stamina#Quick Actions\|Quick Action]] is not doubled as long as it is the declared quick action.
