Every [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] can perform 1 free [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Action]] without any cost. A free [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Action]] is a very quick and low-energy task.

Free [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Actions]] are separate from all other [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Actions]]. They ignore the cost of the previous [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Action]] and do not affect the cost of the next action.

If a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] wishes to perform more than 1 free [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Action]] in a round, they must expend 1 [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Stamina\|Stamina]] point for every extra free [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Action]] to do so.


## Example Free Actions
- [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Equipped\|Equipping]] or Unequipping an [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Item]].
- Studying another [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] to gain information.
- Taking a [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions#Step\|Step]]. (This also triggers a step allowing you to [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] 2 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|tiles]] total)
- Using an [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|item]] or object in the environment or that is [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Equipped\|Equipped]].
- Reloading a ranged [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Item Property Lists/Basic Properties/Weapon\|Weapon]].
- A quick shout to another Character.
