[[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] is categorized into four distinct types: [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Physical\|Physical]], [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Temperate\|Temperate]], [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Chemical\|Chemical]], and [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Mental\|Mental]]. 

When a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] takes [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] from a [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] source, the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] must choose to either expend an equal amount of [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] to avoid the [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] or to not expend [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] and lose an equal amount of [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Hit Points\|Hit Points]]. If the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has no [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] left. Then the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has no choice but to lose [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Hit Points\|Hit Points]].

A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can also use [[Core Rules/Damage/Resistances\|Resistances]] to avoid [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] entirely.
