Damage is categorized into four distinct types: [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Physical\|Physical]], [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Temperate\|Temperate]], [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Chemical\|Chemical]], and [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Mental\|Mental]]. 

When a character takes Damage from a Damage source, the character must choose to either expend an equal amount of [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] to avoid the Damage or to not expend [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] and lose an equal amount of [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Hit Points\|Hit Points]]. If the character has no [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] left. Then the character has no choice but to lose [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Hit Points\|Hit Points]].

A character can also use [[Core Rules/Damage/Resistances\|Resistances]] to avoid damage entirely.
