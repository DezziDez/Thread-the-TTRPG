[[Character\|Characters]] can take cover behind [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] to protect themselves. The cover itself though can take the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]] and once the cover is destroyed the protection is gone.

Areas of Effect that do not [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Move\|Move]] around corners cannot hit the Character.

#### Half Cover
