An Area of Effect or AOE is an area in which all [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] are effected.
AOE's are categorized as, Controlled or Uncontrolled, Blocked or Spreading, and Instant or Lingering.

>[!Examples]
>An explosion such as a Bomb would be Uncontrolled, Blocked, and Instant.
>A blast weapon such as a shotgun would be Controlled, Blocked, and Instant.
>A blanket of liquid fire such as an eruption of lava would be Uncontrolled, Spreading, and Lingering.

## Origin
AOE's have an Origin point unless otherwise stated, this spot in space is where the AOE starts and spreads out from. This Origin point needs to be clear so that targets of the AOE can be determined.
## Controlled and Uncontrolled
AOE's can either be Controlled or Uncontrolled. This determines if a Character has the ability to aim or target specific areas, Characters, or [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] rather than all things in an area.
#### Controlled
A Controlled AOE can be manipulated to target specific Characters or [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] within the area. The inverse is also true. A Controlled AOE can be manipulated to not target specific Characters or Objects.
#### Uncontrolled
An Uncontrolled AOE is indiscriminate. It targets everything within the area regardless of intent.
## Blocking and Spreading
AOE's can either be Blocking or Spreading. This simply determines whether or not the AOE can move around corners or move through [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] such as walls.
#### Blocking
An AOE that is blocking is stopped by [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] that provide sufficient cover. Characters that are behind sufficient cover from the Origin point of the AOE are not targeted by the AOE.
#### Spreading
An AOE that is Spreading can move around corners or through some [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] as specified in the AOE.
## Instant and Lingering
AOE's can either be Instant or Lingering. This represents how long the AOE is around for.
#### Instant
An Instant AOE is as Instant as Instant gets. The amount of time the AOE is around for is so short that nothing could be done about it. 

>[!Note]
>A Character may want to use a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina#Quick Actions\|Quick Action]] as a reaction to another character performing an action that may cause the AOE. Though, the speed of the action and the results are determined by [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]].
#### Lingering
A Lingering AOE stays around for an amount of time determined by the AOE in effect.
