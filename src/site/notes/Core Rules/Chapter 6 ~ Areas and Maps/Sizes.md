[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] may come in various shapes and sizes. These sizes represent the largest dimension in [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Steps\|Steps]] of that Character or Object.

These sizes can scale up or down infinitely. But are generally rounded to their closest number of steps.
#### Size Table

| Number of Steps | Size   |
| --------------- | ------ |
| <0.25           | Minute |
| 0.5             | Tiny   |
| 1               | Small  |
| 2               | Medium |
| 3               | Large  |
| 4               | Huge   |
| ...             | ...    |
## Representation
Some Tables may use some kind of visual representation of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] on a map. These are usually referred to as tokens. These tokens have no restriction on their dimension outside of the size table.
>[!Example]
>A massive serpent that has 10 steps as their largest dimension. But the rest of their body is more cylindrical with 2 steps as their second largest dimension. So [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] may choose to represent the serpent in 5 medium sized segments that move together.
>
>The serpent would still be a Size 10 Character, but their representation would be more accurate. Allowing for more dynamic [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Events\|Events]].
