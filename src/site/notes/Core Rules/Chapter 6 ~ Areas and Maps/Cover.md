[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] can take Cover behind [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] or other [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] to protect themselves from dangers.

If an [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Attack\|Attack]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Area of Effect\|Area of Effect]] would damage a Character that is sufficiently blocked by cover, the damage would go to the cover rather than the Character.
This is effective until the Character moves out of cover, the attacker goes around the cover, or the cover is [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Object Health\|Destroyed]]

>[!Note]
>[[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Area of Effect#Spreading\|Spreading]] AOE's are not affected by Cover.
