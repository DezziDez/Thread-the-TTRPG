There are various Ranges in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] that help determine the how close things are without exact distances. These distances have names but can also be referred to by [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]]. Each Rank is always twice as far as the previous Rank making distances greater than Away easy to create for settings that might have weapons or situations that allows Characters to be targeted at extreme distances.
## Close, Rank 0
Close Range is anything that is within direct reach of another [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Character]]. This is generally one or two [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Steps\|Steps]] away depending on the situation.

>[!Note]
>One Step away would be directly next to the Character.

## Near, Rank 1
Near Range is anything that is at most 10 Steps away. Most [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] can move this distance with one [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Move\|Move]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]].
## Far, Rank 2
Far Range is anything that is at most 20 steps away.
## Very Far, Rank 3
Very Far Range is anything that is at most 40 steps away.
## Distant, Rank 4
Distant is anything that is at most 80 steps away.
## Very Distant, Rank 5
Very Distant is anything that is at most 160 steps away.
## Away, Rank 6
Away is any distance that is greater than 160 steps.

# In Step
In Step is when a [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Character]] or Object is 1-2 steps outside of a certain Range. Such as a Character being 1-2 steps away from being close. This primarily is used to know that a Character making a [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions#Quick Step\|Quick Step]] can get within range of the target.

Some [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Perks\|Perks]] may bridge this gap and allow Characters to target other Characters or [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] that are In Step.
