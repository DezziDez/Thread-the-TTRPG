An action is a short period of time that effects the world in meaningful ways.
## Stamina Cost
All actions have a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] cost. This cost represents how much energy it takes to use that action.
## Burn
When a Character performs any action, unless otherwise specified, they always discard one card from their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/The Deck and Discard\|Pool of Cards]]. This is known as Burn and represents the long term cost of short term actions.
## Step
When a Character performs any action, unless otherwise specified, they are allowed to move 1 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|tile]] in any direction they can access. This movement is called a step and can be taken before or after the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] itself. Steps are not restricted by the [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Slowed\|Slowed]] [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Conditions\|condition]] unless the character's [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Speed\|Speed]] is 0.
