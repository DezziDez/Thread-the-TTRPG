### Description
A Character moves through the terrain at their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Speed\|Speed]].

#### Using Move
- The Character moves a number of [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]] up to their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Speed\|Speed]]. 
- If a Character does not use the entirety of their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Speed\|Speed]] before using another [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|action]] or ending their [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|turn]], the remaining speed is lost and the Character must use the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] again to use their speed.
- A Character can inflict themselves with the [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Prone\|Prone]] [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Conditions\|condition]] while using Move. Doing so costs 2 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]] of speed.
- If the Character can stand up, they may do so while using Move. Removing the [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Prone\|Prone]] [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Conditions\|condition]]. Doing so costs 4 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]] of speed.

### Notes
A Character is allowed to use a [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions#Step\|Step]] before or after taking the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] as this does not count towards their speed.
