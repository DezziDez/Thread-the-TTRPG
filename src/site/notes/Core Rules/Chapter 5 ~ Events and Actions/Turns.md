A Turn is a Character's localized time bubble that allows them to perform [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] and effect the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Events\|Event]].

## Turn Phases
Turns are performed in phases that can be resolved quickly with practice.

Start of a Character's Turn:
- Any effects that trigger at the beginning of the Character's turn trigger in any order the Character wishes them to.

Middle of the Character's Turn:
- The Character uses [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] to effect the situation.

End of the Character's Turn:
- A Character cannot use any [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina#Quick Actions\|Quick Actions]] during the end of turn phase.
- Any effects that trigger at the end of a Character's turn trigger trigger in the order chosen by the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]].
