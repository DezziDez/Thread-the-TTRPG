An event is anything that might need careful planning or swift [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] by the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] involved. An event is broken down into Rounds and the length of an event is only as long as the number of Rounds it takes before it is decided that the Event has ended.

Common events are combat, timed challenges/puzzles, complex social encounters, or dangerous environments.
## Declaration
An event can be declared by the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Players\|The Players]] at any time for any reason.
# Rounds
A Round is a period of 10 seconds that is broken up into [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turns]] by the individual [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] in the Event.

If anything were to trigger at the beginning of a Round, it always triggers first before any turns and in any order determined by [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]].
## Turn Order
At the beginning of an Event, [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] determines the initiator of an Event. The Initiator goes first and begins their [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]].

After a Character ends their turn, that Character chooses who begins their Turn next.

Once all Characters in the Event have had a Turn. The last Character chooses the Character to begin their Turn of the next Round.
## Hidden Characters
Whenever a Character is hidden and unknown to other Characters. The hidden Character may choose to have their Turn instead of a Character who is unaware of them.
