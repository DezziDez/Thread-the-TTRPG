All [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] can perform basic [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] and [[Core Rules/Actions/Free Actions\|Free Actions]]. 
All basic [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] cost 2 [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] points when used. 
## Step
When a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] performs any action, unless otherwise specified, they are allowed to move 1 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Tiles\|tile]] in any direction they can access. This movement is called a step and can be taken before or after the [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] itself. Steps are not restricted by the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] condition unless the character's speed is 0.
