## Cost
All actions have a [[Core Rules/Stamina\|Stamina]] cost. This cost represents how much energy it takes to use that action.

All [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] can perform basic [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] and [[Core Rules/Free Actions\|Free Actions]]. 
All basic [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] cost 3 [[Core Rules/Stamina\|Stamina]] points when used.
## Step
When a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] performs any action, unless otherwise specified, they are allowed to [[Core Rules/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] 1 [[Core Rules/Tiles\|tile]] in any direction they can access. This movement is called a step and can be taken before or after the [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] itself. Steps are not restricted by the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] unless the character's [[Core Rules/Speed\|speed]] is 0.
