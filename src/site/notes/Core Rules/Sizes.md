Every [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has a size. The size of a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] determines the number of [[Core Rules/Tiles\|Tiles]] they take up on a map and in physical space.

A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] increases by 1 [[Core Rules/Tiles\|tile]] for every size category above Medium and decreases by 1/2 a [[Core Rules/Tiles\|tile]] for every category below Medium. There is no hard limit to how large or small a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can be, but practically [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] can be too small or too large to manage for the game.

The names of the sizes beyond Small, Medium, and Large have no real meaning and can easily be changed.
