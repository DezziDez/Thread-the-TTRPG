Everything on a character sheet has a rank. Whether that be [[Core Rules/Skills\|Skills]], [[Core Rules/Abilities\|Abilities]], [[Core Rules/Items\|Items]], or [[Core Rules/Damage/Resistances\|Resistances]]. The rank of something determines it's power and everything starts at rank 1. These ranks can be increased by spendingÂ [[Core Rules/Rank Points\|Rank Points]].

Each rank not only represents the power level of something. But it also has an associated die value as represented in the table below.
#### Rank Table:
| Rank | Die | Average |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | d2 | 2 |
| 2 | d4 | 3 |
| 3 | d6 | 4 |
| 4 | d8 | 5 |
| 5 | d10 | 6 |
| 6 | d12 | 7 |
| 7 | d12+2 | 8 |
| 8 | d12+4 | 9 |
| 9 | d12+6 | 10 |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Ability Ranks
All of the [[Core Rules/Abilities\|Abilities]] have a rank. This rank simply represents the die value of that ability. For example, if a character has Agility at rank 3 then the die value for Agility is a d6.

## Skill Ranks
Each skill has an associated rank. While a skill might use the die value of the rank, most skills do not.

## Resistance Ranks
Each type of [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] can have an associated [[Core Rules/Damage/Resistances\|Resistance]]. Use the die on the Rank Table to determine what to roll when subtracting damage.

## Condition Ranks
Some [[Core Rules/Conditions\|Conditions]] can have multiple ranks of that condition. Multiple ranks of a condition have stacking effects as described by the condition.

## Item Ranks
[[Core Rules/Items\|Items]] can have ranks. An item can have a number of properties equal to the rank of the item.
