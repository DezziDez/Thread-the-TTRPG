- You suffer 1 point of [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage Types/Physical\|Physical]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] at the end of your turn for every [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks\|Ranks]] of the Bleeding [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|Condition]]. 
- [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] from the Bleeding [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|Condition]] ignores [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]], dealing [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] directly to [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Health\|Health]] instead.
