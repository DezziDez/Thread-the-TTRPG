Conditions are effects that can be applied to [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]]. Conditions all have a description that provides information as to what exactly each condition does.

Conditions last for the duration specified when a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] is inflicted with the condition.

When a condition is removed or ends, all effects of a condition are also removed except [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] caused by the condition.

Some conditions can have multiple ranks. These [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ranks\|Ranks]] apply greater effects to the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] inflicted with the condition. Each condition describes if it can have additional rank, how many [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ranks\|Ranks]] it can have, and the effects of having more [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ranks\|Ranks]].
