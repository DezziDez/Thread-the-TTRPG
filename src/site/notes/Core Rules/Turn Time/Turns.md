A turn is a character's localized time bubble that allows them to perform [[Core Rules/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] and effect the situation.

## Turn Phases
Turns are performed in phases that can be resolved quickly with practice.

Start of a Character's Turn:
- The characters [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] is brought back up to it's maximum value if it was reduced.
- Any effects that trigger at the beginning of the Character's turn trigger in any order the Character wishes them to.

Middle of the Character's Turn:
- Start the [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Turn Timer\|Turn Timer]].
- The Character uses [[Core Rules/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] to effect the situation.

End of the Character's Turn:
- Stop the [[Turn Timer.\|Turn Timer.]]
- A Character cannot use any [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina#Quick Actions\|Quick Actions]] during the end of turn phase.
- Any effects that trigger at the end of a Character's turn trigger trigger in the order chosen by the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]].
