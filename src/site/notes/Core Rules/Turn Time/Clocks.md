A clock is a general purpose tool to represent progress. They can be used to represent the time before a significant event occurs, such as a time limit before a bomb goes off. They can be used to represent progress in a Characters action, such as a character attempting pick a lock under pressure.

Clocks are represented with circles split into even sections that shows the number of triggers before the event is completed. The event triggering when all sections are filled.

The reason to fill each section can be anything. Successful [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]], a number of [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Rounds\|Rounds]] during [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Events\|Events]]. A literal amount of real life time like minutes or hours. Anything the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] wants the time to represent it can represent and it is a great tool to represent to [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|Players]] how long something is going to take.
