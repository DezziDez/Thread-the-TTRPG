Rank Points are the representation of power, progression, and [[Core Rules/Skills\|Skill]] for any character. They are used to increase the [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] of [[Core Rules/Abilities\|Abilities]] or to purchase new [[Core Rules/Skills\|Skills]] during a [[Core Rules/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]].

A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] gains Unspent Rank Points at the end of every session or at the end of a large event. The [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] awards [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] with Rank Points based on their judgement. Generally, at least 1 Rank Point should be awarded to each [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] at the end of each session.

After a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] uses Unspent Rank Points, they become Spent Rank Points.

## Spent Rank Points
The number of spent rank points a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has can be used to quickly determine how strong a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] is. This can be used for balancing [[Core Rules/Events\|Events]] with other [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|characters]] or just as a quick representation of [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] growth.
