Hit Points are the life force and ability to survive.

The maximum amount of Stamina a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has is easily represented by taking two dice equal to the value of the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] Vitality.
- For example, if a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has 3 ranks in Vitality, then that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] represents their Hit Points with 2d6 set to their maximum value, 12 is the maximum Hit Points in this case. Subtracting hit points is done by decreasing the value on the dice.

Hit Points are reduced mainly when a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] takes [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]]. This is generally avoided by consuming [[Core Rules/Stamina\|Stamina]].

## Dying
If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] hit points would reach 0 hit points, the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] suffers 1 rank of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition for every point of remaining [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] that would reduce the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] hit points below 0. [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] cannot be below 0 [[Core Rules/Hit Points\|Hit Points]].

If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] reaches 0 ranks of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition, the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] regains 1 hit point.

After a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has gained enough ranks of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition that the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] will be made unconscious due to a lack of maximum [[Core Rules/Stamina\|Stamina]]. The dying [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] must now make Vitality+Will [[Core Rules/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] at the end of their turn against the number of ranks of [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] they have in order to remain alive.

A dying and unconscious [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] that succeeds this ability check 3 times becomes stable. A stable [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] no longer has to make Vitality+Will [[Core Rules/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] and will have all of their [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] removed after a [[Core Rules/Resting#Break\|Break]]. A dying and unconscious [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] that fails 3 times dies.

## Overkill
If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] were to drop to 0 hit points and have enough remaining [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] to equal to twice the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] maximum hit points, that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] would die instantly.
