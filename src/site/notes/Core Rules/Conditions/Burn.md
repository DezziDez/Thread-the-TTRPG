- You suffer 1 point of [[Core Rules/Damage Types/Temperate\|Temperate]] [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] at the end of your turn for every [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] of the Burn [[Core Rules/Conditions\|Condition]].
- [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] from the Burn [[Core Rules/Conditions\|Condition]] ignores [[Core Rules/Stamina\|Stamina]], dealing [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] directly to [[Core Rules/Hit Points\|Hit Points]] instead.

##### Note
This condition applies to fire burning from heat and frost burn from cold.
