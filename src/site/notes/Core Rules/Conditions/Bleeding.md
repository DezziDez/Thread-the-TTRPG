- You suffer 1 point of [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Physical\|Physical]] [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] at the end of your turn for every [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] of the Bleeding [[Core Rules/Conditions\|Condition]]. 
- [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] from the Bleeding [[Core Rules/Conditions\|Condition]] ignores [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]], dealing [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] directly to [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Hit Points\|Hit Points]] instead.
