Conditions are effects that can be applied to characters. Conditions all have a description that provides information as to what exactly each condition does.

Conditions last for the duration specified when a character is inflicted with the condition.

When a condition is removed or ends, all effects of a condition are also removed except damage caused by the condition.

Some conditions can have multiple ranks. These ranks apply greater effects to the character inflicted with the condition. Each condition describes if it can have additional rank, how many ranks it can have, and the effects of having more ranks.
