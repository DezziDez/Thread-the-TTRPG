Conditions are effects that can be applied to characters. Conditions all have a description that provides information as to what exactly each condition does.

Conditions last for the duration specified when a character is inflicted with the condition.

When a condition is removed or ends, all effects of a condition are also removed except [[Core Rules/Damage\|damage]] caused by the condition.

Some conditions can have multiple ranks. These [[Core Rules/Ranks\|ranks]] apply greater effects to the character inflicted with the condition. Each condition describes if it can have additional rank, how many [[Core Rules/Ranks\|ranks]] it can have, and the effects of having more [[Core Rules/Ranks\|ranks]].
