Thread is an open source TTRPG connected together into a series of pages using Obsidian. Allowing for non-sequential navigation of all the rules and mechanics.

Thread is designed with Creativity, Modularity, Emergence, and Simplicity in mind. There are only have a few hard rules in Thread that you should always follow.
1. **Change It!** The system is designed to be altered. Put rules in, take rules out, or change them into something else. Nothing is marked as optional because everything is optional.
2. **Make it!** If the rules don't support what you want, make your own! The system is completely modular and open-source, so add anything you like and even share it with the world.
3. **Break it!** Whether player or game master, do whatever you want. The system wants to be bent and broken. Go wild and make the craziest of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]], encounters, items, beasts, or whatever insanity you can come up with.

Thread is entirely setting agnostic. Allowing you to use the system in any world for any [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]]. There is also explicitly no flavor added to any skills, only mechanics. This is to reduce the number of characters in [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] to reduce confusion and reading. But, it is also to have as little restrictions on the potential flavor of the skills. Thread will never tell you how to interpret anything.


## Mission Statement

Hello, I'm Dez, the creator of Thread.

I have been building this system for a long time now and it is my personal passion project. I love TTRPGs and the magic they can bring to the world. I felt so restrained by other systems that I've used, so I wanted to make something that doesn't quite exist. Taking all the knowledge I have gained about game design and distilling it into one place.

Setting agnostic, Modular, no restrictions. That is what I have wanted in a system. A set of rules for everyone to follow that is robust enough to give players and game masters something to work with but not so boiled down that you have to make everything yourself. Rules that are as simple to understand and flexible as possible. No confusing math. No calculators required.

This project has been one of the more difficult and time consuming things I've done. And I've done some hard things. So I genuinely hope you enjoy what I have made.
