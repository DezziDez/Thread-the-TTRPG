# Welcome to Thread!
Thread is an [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/Open Source\|open source]], rules light, fully modular, setting agnostic, table-top role playing system.

Thread is designed with Creativity, Modularity, Emergence, and Simplicity in mind. Giving all the rules and mechanics and examples necessary to make your own worlds and ideas without limitations. Thread is a set of guide rails that can be changed and altered at any time for any reason. There is no right way to play Thread. Only the way that is the most fun for everyone.

## Optional
Everything in Thread is optional and nothing is set in stone. Everything can be changed, removed, replaced, altered, or re-imagined to fit any setting or play style.

Thread is a loosely connected set of rules and was designed to explicitly be changed for the needs of you and your group.

## Setting Agnostic
Thread is a series of rules and guidelines with no setting attached. This means that there are no restrictions to what you can and cannot do with this system. You can even use settings and rules from other systems using the rules here on the fly!

## Simplicity in Emergence
One of the core ideas of Thread is that the system should be as simple to understand and easy to pick up as possible. Minimal learning curve.

However, there are many [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Players\|The Players]] that enjoy complexity and getting deep into the details. So, Thread splits the difference by using a emergence as a core feature of its mechanics.

Emergence is the concept in which complexity arises from a series of simplistic rules.

Due to Threads many ways of playing and modular systems. Emergence comes naturally and coming up with interesting and powerful combinations is highly encouraged.

## Story Telling
Thread is a system built around the concept of story telling. Whether sitting around a campfire or at a table with a large map and tablets. Story telling is the focus and these of Thread.

Thread is built to be a collaborative and fun experience for everyone involved. So tell your story for now and for the future.
