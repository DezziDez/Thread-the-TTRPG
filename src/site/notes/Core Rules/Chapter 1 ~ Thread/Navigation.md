Thread was designed inside a program called [Obsidian.](https://obsidian.md/)

Obsidian is a piece of software that allows for non-linear navigation of the material using links to other pages. The entirety of [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] is written in Markdown, which is a standardized text formatting language. This means that Thread can be downloaded and used in any software that can read Markdown functions, or even read directly using any word processor.

In Thread, pages are linked together using Threads. These are breadcrumb trails that can be followed around the entirety of the system. These Threads can be followed at any time to reference a piece of information found in another location in the system.
## How to Navigate Thread
Hovering over a link in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] allows you to see the linked content without directly navigating to it.

There is a search function in the top left that does a text search of the entire system which allows you to find anything you might be looking for.

Lastly, you can see on the right there is a web of dots and lines marked as "Connected Pages". This web of threads can be used to navigate to any page in the system to any other page with a simple click.

Experiment and move around the system as much as you like!
