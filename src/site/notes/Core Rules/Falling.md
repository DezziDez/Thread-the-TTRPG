#### Fall Damage
If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] falls more than 1 [[Core Rules/Tiles\|Tile]] then that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] would take [[Core Rules/Damage Types/Physical\|Physical]] [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] equal to twice the number of [[Core Rules/Tiles\|Tiles]] they fell.

#### Hang Time
If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] were to fall outside of their turn, they do not fall until after the beginning of their [[Core Rules/Turns\|Turn]]. The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has 1 [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] to prevent themselves from falling.
If that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] cannot prevent themselves from falling, they fall 100 [[Core Rules/Tiles\|Tiles]] and can continue with the rest of their [[Core Rules/Turns\|Turn]]. If the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] is still falling by the end of their [[Core Rules/Turns\|Turn]], they fall 400 [[Core Rules/Tiles\|Tiles]].
