## What are Skills
[[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] are the main access to power and ability in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Threads/Thread\|Thread]]. Instead of having a standard set way of play, [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Threads/Thread\|Thread]] offers the ability to mix and match [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] to make unique [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]] of any kind.

## Purchasing Skills
Whenever a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] spends [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Points\|Points]] during a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]] they may purchase a [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] instead of increase the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Ranks]] of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|Abilities]].

Every [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] is associated with an [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|ability]]. When a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] wishes to purchase a [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] they must have a number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Ranks]] in the associated [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|ability]] to equal the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] that [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] wishes to take.

For example, if a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] wishes to purchase a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] 3 [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] in Agility, that [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] must first have at least 3 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Ranks]] in the Agility [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|ability]].

The [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] must then spend a number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Points\|Points]] equal to the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]].

For example, if a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] wishes to purchase a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] 2 skill. They must spend 2 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Points\|Points]] to purchase it.

## Refresh
Some [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] can only be used a certain number of times before they need to be refreshed. The [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] will describe the conditions for a refresh but this is usually performed during [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Resting\|Resting]].

A [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] may have a variable number of uses before a refresh. These are usually based on the number of ranks of the associated [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|ability]] and a multiplier.

For example, 2xMight / [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Resting#Break\|Break]] would be twice the number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Might of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] for every [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Resting#Break\|Break]].

Whenever a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] has a skill that can be upgraded to a greater [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]]. The [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] may choose to spend the required number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Points\|Points]] to increase the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] of that skill. This cost is the same as purchasing a new skill and has the same requirements.
