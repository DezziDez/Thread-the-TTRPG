Effects:
Whenever you take the [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Actions\|Action]] without a [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Items/Item Property Lists/Basic Properties/Weapon\|Weapon]] you may add your Will [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Die]] to your [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Damage\|Damage]]. The resulting [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] would be [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Ability Check Combinations/Might+Will\|Might+Will]] instead of just Might.
