Everything on a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] sheet has a rank. Whether that be [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]], [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|Abilities]], [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Items/Items\|Items]], or [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Resistances\|Resistances]]. The [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] of something determines it's power, everything starting at [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] 1 and generally not going higher than [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] 6. These ranks can be increased by spendingÂ [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Points\|Points]].

Each [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] not only represents the power level of something. But it also has an associated [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Die]] value as represented in the table below.
#### Rank Table:
| Rank | Die | Average |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | d2 | 2 |
| 2 | d4 | 3 |

## Ability Ranks
All of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|Abilities]] have a rank. This [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] simply represents the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Die]] value of that ability. For example, if a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] has Agility at [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] 3 then the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Die]] value for Agility is a d6.

## Skill Ranks
Each [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] has an associated rank. While a [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] might use the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Die]] value of the rank, most [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] do not.

## Resistance Ranks
Each type of [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Damage\|Damage]] can have an associated [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Resistances\|Resistance]].

## Condition Ranks
Some [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Conditions\|Conditions]] can have multiple ranks of that condition. Multiple ranks of a condition have stacking effects as described by the condition.

## Item Ranks WIP
[[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Items/Items\|Items]] can have ranks. An [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Items/Items\|Item]] can have a number of properties equal to the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Items/Items\|Item]].
