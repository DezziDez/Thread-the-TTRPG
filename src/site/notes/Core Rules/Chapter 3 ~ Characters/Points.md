Points are the representation of power, progression, and [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] for any character. They are used to increase the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Ranks]] of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|Abilities]] or to purchase new [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] during a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]].

A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] gains Unspent Points at the end of every session or at the end of a large event. The [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] awards [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] with Points based on their judgement. Generally, at least 1 Point should be awarded to each [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] at the end of each session.

After a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] uses Unspent Points, they become Spent Points.

## Spent Points
The number of Spent Points a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] has can be used to quickly determine how strong a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] is. This can be used for balancing [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Events\|Events]] with other [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]] or just as a quick representation of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] growth.
