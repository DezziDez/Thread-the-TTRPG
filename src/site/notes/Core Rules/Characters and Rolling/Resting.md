## Rest Definition
A period of light activity, called a Rest, is used by [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] to regain energy and wits. During this time, a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] can perform low-stress activities like crafting or bartering but not high-stress ones like combat or intense mental tasks.

There are three types of rests: Full-Rest, Half-Rest, and Break. 
Higher levels of rest are counted towards any requirements for lower levels of rest.

### Full-Rest
A Full-Rest takes a full day, (usually 24 hours)
[[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] can spend [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Points\|Points]], restore [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Health\|Health]] to their maximum, and reset all conditions unless otherwise stated.
### Half-Rest
A Half-Rest, takes at least 6 hours.
[[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] can restore Health equal to their [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Vitality.

[Characters](https://thread-the-ttrpg.vercel.app/ttrpg-basics/character/) have a number of half rests available to use equal to their ranks in Will. Once a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has used all of their Half-Rests they must take a Full-Rest to regain them.
### Break
A Break, taking at least one hour.
A break has no direct benefits except to take time to shrug off certain conditions, effects, or to refresh skills.

### **NOT** Resting
All [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] must take at least one Half-Rest every full day or else they will suffer one [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Exhausted\|Exhausted]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]].
