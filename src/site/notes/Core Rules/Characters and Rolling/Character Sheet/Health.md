Health are the life force and ability to survive.

The maximum amount of Health a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has is easily represented by taking two dice equal to the value of the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] Vitality.
- For example, if a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has 3 ranks in Vitality, then that [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] represents their Health with 2d6 set to their maximum value, 12 is the maximum Health in this case. Subtracting Health is done by decreasing the value on the dice.

Health are reduced mainly when a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] takes [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]]. This is generally avoided by consuming [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]].

## Dying
If a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character's]] Health would reach 0, the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] suffers 1 [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition for every point of remaining [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] that would reduce the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character's]] Health below 0. [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] cannot be below 0 [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Health\|Health]].

If a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] reaches 0 ranks of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition, the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] regains 1 Health.

After a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has gained enough ranks of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition that the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] will be made [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] due to a lack of maximum [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]]. The dying [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] must now make [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Ability Check Combinations/Vitality+Will\|Vitality+Will]] [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] at the end of their turn against the number of ranks of [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]] they have in order to remain alive.

A [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] and [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] that succeeds this [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Ability Checks\|Ability Check]] 3 times becomes stable. A stable [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] no longer has to make [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Ability Check Combinations/Vitality+Will\|Vitality+Will]] [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] and will have all of their [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks\|Ranks]] of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]] removed after a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Resting#Break\|Break]]. A dying and unconscious [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] that fails 3 times dies.

## Overkill
If a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] were to drop to 0 Health and have enough remaining [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] to equal to twice the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] maximum Health, that [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] would die instantly.
