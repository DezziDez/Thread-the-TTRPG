All [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] have a speed stat that determines how far that [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] can [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] on solid ground.

A character's speed is determined by adding together their ranks in Agility and Might together. Then doubling it.
- For example, if a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has 2 [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Agility and 3 [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Might, the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has 2+3=5, 5+5=10 speed. That [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] can then [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] 10 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|Tiles]] when they used the [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] action.

Whenever a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] wants to [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] through a more difficult environment such as swimming, climbing, or moving through bramble. That [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] suffers 1 [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Slowed\|Slowed]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]] until the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] stops moving.
