Everything on a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] sheet has a rank. Whether that be [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]], [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Abilities\|Abilities]], [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Items]], or [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Resistances\|Resistances]]. The rank of something determines it's power, everything starting at rank 1 and generally not going higher than rank 6. These ranks can be increased by spendingÂ [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Rank Points\|Rank Points]].

Each rank not only represents the power level of something. But it also has an associated die value as represented in the table below.
#### Rank Table:
| Rank | Die | Average |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | d2 | 2 |
| 2 | d4 | 3 |
| 3 | d6 | 4 |
| 4 | d8 | 5 |
| 5 | d10 | 6 |
| 6 | d12 | 7 |
| 7 | d12+1 | 8 |
| 8 | d12+2 | 9 |
| 9 | d12+3 | 10 |
| 10 | d20 | 11 |

## Ability Ranks
All of the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Abilities\|Abilities]] have a rank. This rank simply represents the die value of that ability. For example, if a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has Agility at rank 3 then the die value for Agility is a d6.

## Skill Ranks
Each [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] has an associated rank. While a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skill]] might use the die value of the rank, most [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] do not.

## Resistance Ranks
Each type of [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] can have an associated [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Resistances\|Resistance]]. Use the die on the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Ranks#Rank Table\|Rank Table]] to determine what to roll when subtracting [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]].

## Condition Ranks
Some [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|Conditions]] can have multiple ranks of that condition. Multiple ranks of a condition have stacking effects as described by the condition.

## Item Ranks WIP
[[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Items]] can have ranks. An [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Item]] can have a number of properties equal to the rank of the [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Item]].
