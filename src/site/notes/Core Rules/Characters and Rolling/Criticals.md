A critical or crit is an extreme of high or lows that drives tension and adds potential swingy-ness to a game.

## Critical Success
A critical success is when an [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Ability Checks\|ability check]] or an [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] is made and both dice land on their maximum value. When this happens, the total roll is doubled, potentially making the roll a success or dealing twice as much [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] if that roll was an [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]].

Some additional event may occur due to a critical success based on the situation. This is known as a brutal critical success and it is up to the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] to determine the outcome of the great success.


## Critical Failure
A critical failure is when an [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Ability Checks\|ability check]] or an [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] is made and both dice land on 1. When this happens the check automatically fails and no [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] is dealt if that roll was an [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]].

Some additional event may occur due to a critical failure based on the situation. This is known as a brutal critical fail and it is up to the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] to determine the outcome of the great failure.

## Boons and Banes with Criticals
[[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] can gain [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Boon and Bane\|Boons or Banes]] from certain skills, conditions, or situations, affecting their rolls. If two of these, either Boons or Banes, force a critical roll in either direction, the critical should not be counted. 

Example 1: If a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has two [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Boon and Bane\|Banes]], they would have two guaranteed natural 1s. In this case, the occurrence of two critical failures wouldn't happen. Same goes for [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Boon and Bane\|Boons]] and a critical success. 

Example 2: If a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has one [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Boon and Bane\|Bane]], they will have one guaranteed natural 1. This would result in a critical failure if another natural 1 appears on their other [[TTRPG Basics/Dice\|Die]] roll. The same applies to [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Boon and Bane\|Boons]] and a critical success
