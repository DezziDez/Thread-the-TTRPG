The vast majority of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/What is a TTRPG\|TTRPGs]] have some form of randomness in the system to give a sense of drama and tension. You can't always control your actions down to the exact detail. Sometimes, you just need to roll the dice. Or in this case, play your cards.

In [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]], each [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Players\|Player]] will use a [standard 52-card deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck) of playing cards with the addition of 2 different jokers, often two different colors such as black and red.

Thread will reference these cards as follows:

| Name  | Value | Name       | Symbol |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| Ace   | 1     | Clubs      | ♣      |
| 2     | 2     | Diamonds   | ♦      |
| 3     | 3     | Hearts     | ♥      |
| 4     | 4     | Spades     | ♠      |
| 5     | 5     | Good Joker | +🃏    |
| 6     | 6     | Bad Joker  | -🃏    |
| 7     | 7     |            |        |
| 8     | 8     |            |        |
| 9     | 9     |            |        |
| 10    | 10    |            |        |
| Jack  | 11    |            |        |
| Queen | 12    |            |        |
| King  | 13    |            |        |

## Jokers
Jokers are used in Thread to represent extremely unlikely situations. There are two Jokers, a +🃏 and a -🃏. The +🃏 represents something extremely good, while the -🃏 represents something extremely bad.

It is important that each player assigns which of their Jokers is good and bad before the game begins.

Whenever a Joker is drawn, it **MUST** be used, unless otherwise stated.
