A TTRPG, or Table Top Role Playing Game, is a series of rules and mechanics that allows a group of people to interact with a fictional world and make stories together. It is a medium of art and expression that is enjoyed by many.

As the name suggests, TTRPGs are comprised of a few main functions.

#### Table Top
This game is designed to be played similar to a board game or card game. Where you gather a group to sit around a table, virtual or physical, to enjoy this experience with each other and have fun while doing it.

#### Role Playing
This type of game does involve getting into a character. Observing the other players at the table, interacting with their characters with your character, taking actions, making mistakes, and overall playing pretend.

#### Game
It's always very important to remember that this is just a game. A thing you are all willingly doing to have fun, make memories, and tells stories about in the future.
