The Players in a TTRPG are the real life people in the game that aren't the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]]. They are responsible for controlling [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] of their own to change the world around them and make choices.

Players may control any character at any time given the consent of The Weaver and potentially another Player that may have ownership of that Character.
This method of Character swapping can give many opportunities to tell scenes of the story that may not be viewed from the perspective of any main Characters.
