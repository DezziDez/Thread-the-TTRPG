There is always one person at your table that is running the whole show and calling all the shots. The generally accepted names for this person is Game Master (GM), Referee, Story Teller, or in the case of [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]], The Weaver.

The Weaver in Thread determines the rules and fates of all [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] in the game. They are responsible for moving the story forward, making declarations on rules, and making sure everyone is having fun. Including themselves.
## Rulings
The Weaver is also responsible to determining what a Character can and cannot do within the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Setting\|Setting]] and rules of Thread. This includes [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Perks\|Perks]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Flaws\|Flaws]], [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] and their [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Properties\|Properties]], as well as any other ruling that may come up during the game.

It is important that The Weaver make fair and justified rulings throughout the game to increase the fun of the story you are all telling together.
