The setting is the world, the universe, the genre, and everything in between. [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] is the backbone rules of the game. But the setting is where the real magic happens. It is generally up to the [[GM\|GM]] as to where the game is taking place and any special rules that are needed to support the setting.

Setting specific example rules and content will be provided for specific genres of play as time goes on. Genres such as, fantasy, sci-fi, modern, steampunk, political intrigue, etc.
Genres and settings can overlap and as always with Thread, everything is optional.
