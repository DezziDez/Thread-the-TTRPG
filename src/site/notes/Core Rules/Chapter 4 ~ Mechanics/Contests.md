[[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] are generally a form of contest, either with another [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] or the environment.

A contest with another [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] involves two [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]] making [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]]. For instance, 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] might roll Insight+Intellect to detect if another person is lying, while the opposing [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] rolls Insight+Will to maintain their deception.

Contests with the environment are much more common. In contests with the environment, the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] determines a difficulty level or [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] of the contest and rolls [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Dice]] accordingly. The [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] must now compete against the result of the roll. Difficulty levels range from Trivial to Extreme. If a more solid number is desired, the average of the rolls can be used.
