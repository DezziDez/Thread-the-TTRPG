A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] may gain an Boon or suffer a Bane in certain situations or through certain skills.
### Boon
When a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] has Boon on a roll, they choose the smallest [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Die]] of that roll and set its value to the highest possible number. For example, if a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] rolls 1d8 and 1d4, they would roll 1d8 and add 4 instead of rolling the 1d4. If there are two Boons, both [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Dice]] are set to their maximum values.
### Bane
If a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] has Bane on a roll, they choose the smallest [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Die]] of that roll and set its value to 1. For example, if a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] rolls 1d8 and 1d4, they would roll 1d8 and add 1 instead of rolling the 1d4. If there are two Banes, both [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Dice]] are set to 1.
#### Both
When a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] has both an Boon and a Bane on a roll, they cancel each other out. However, more Boons or Banes can still be applied afterwards.
