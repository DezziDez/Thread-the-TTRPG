All [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]] can jump by launching themselves in the air. This is done with either a Long Jump or a High Jump.

## Long Jump
A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] uses the [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Actions\|Action]] to make a long jump across a distance equal to their speed stat with 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Condition List/Slowed\|Slowed]] condition for the duration of the jump. If an [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Ability Checks\|ability check]] is desired to cover distances from jumping, Agility+Might is what should be performed.

## High Jump
A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] can use the [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Actions\|Action]] to make a vertical jump up a distance equal to half of their ranks in might. This Includes 0.5 tile values. If an [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Ability Checks\|ability check]] is desired to gain height from jumping, Might+Might is what should be performed.
