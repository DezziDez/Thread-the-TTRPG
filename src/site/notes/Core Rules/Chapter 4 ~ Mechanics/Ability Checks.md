When making an ability check, a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] combines two relevant [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Abilities\|Abilities]] and rolls [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Dice]] for them based on their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Ranks]]. The result of the roll is added together.

For example, if a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] wants to make a Perception check, they might need to roll Agility + Insight. If they have 1d6 in agility and 1d4 in insight, they would roll 1d6+1d4 for the result.

See below for **examples** of different ability checks and their meanings. The [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] decides which check is needed in each situation, and has the final say. Even if a specific check is mentioned in an action, the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] can change it as they see fit.
