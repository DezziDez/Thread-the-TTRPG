Items are objects that characters can [[Core Rules/Actions\|use]], [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|equip]], and [[Core Rules/Inventory/Accessories\|store]]. All items can be broken down into a list of [[Core Rules/Items/Properties/Properties\|properties]] that described how the item functions. The number of properties an item can have is determined by the [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] of the item. An item has a number of properties equal to the rank of the item.

Items can also be [[Core Rules/Items/Crafting\|crafted]] while a character is [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Resting\|Resting]] to make unique items or to gain other resources.
