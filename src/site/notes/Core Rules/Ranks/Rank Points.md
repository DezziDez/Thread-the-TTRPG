Rank Points are the representation of power, progression, and skill for any character. They are used to increase the [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] of [[Core Rules/Abilities/Abilities\|Abilities]] or to purchase new [[Core Rules/Skills/Skills\|Skills]] during a [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]].

A character gains Rank Points at the end of every session or at the end of a large event. The [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] awards character with Rank Points based on their judgement. Generally, at least 1 Rank Point should be awarded to each character at the end of each session.
