Stamina is the fuel and energy for every character. 

The maximum amount of Stamina a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has is easily represented by taking two dice of a value equal to the die value of the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] Will. 
For example, if a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has 2 ranks in Will, then that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] represents their Stamina with 2d4 set to their maximum value, 8 is the maximum Stamina in this case. Subtracting Stamina is done by decreasing the value on the dice.

Stamina is consumed whenever a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] uses an [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] or takes [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]].

Stamina is reset back to its maximum value at the beginning of the character's turn and [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] taken on any previous turn no longer effect the cost of [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] made on the new turn.

## Actions and Rollover
Taking an [[Core Rules/Actions\|action]] consumes Stamina based on the action. 

The cost of subsequent [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] increases by adding the prior action's base cost. This is known as Rollover.

For example, if a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] performs an [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] that costs 3 Stamina points and then performs an [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] that costs 2 Stamina points, the second [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] will actually cost 5 Stamina points. 
If this [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] then carries out another [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] with a cost of 1 Stamina point, this third [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] would cost 3 Stamina points because the base cost of the prior [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] is now 2 Stamina points.

### Continuous Costs
Certain [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] may have ongoing or continuous Stamina costs. These types of [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] provide constant benefits but come with a regular expense that is paid at the start of each of the character's turns.

The cost of these continuous effects is considered their first [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] and must be added to the Stamina cost of the next [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] taken by the character.

If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] is performing a continuous action, they may end that [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] at any time, including outside of their own turn, at no cost.

### Quick Actions
Some situations may require an immediate response from the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]], even outside of their turn. These are called quick [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]]. Performing a quick [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] requires twice as much Stamina as a regular action, including twice the base cost of the last [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] took.

Any [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] may be used as a quick [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] and it is encouraged for [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] to be creative with how and when they spend their Stamina.

### Maximum Stamina
A character's maximum Stamina may be decreased due to certain circumstances or conditions. Should a character's maximum Stamina reach 0, that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] suffers the unconscious condition.
