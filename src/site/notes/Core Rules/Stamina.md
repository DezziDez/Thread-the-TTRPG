Stamina is the fuel and energy for every character. 

The maximum amount of Stamina a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has is easily represented by taking two dice equal to the value of the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] Will.
- For example, if a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has 2 ranks in Will, then that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] represents their Stamina with 2d4 set to their maximum value, 8 is the maximum Stamina in this case. Subtracting Stamina is done by decreasing the value on the dice.

Stamina is consumed whenever a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] uses an [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] or takes [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]].

Stamina is reset back to its maximum value at the beginning of the character's turn and [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] taken on any previous turn no longer effect the cost of [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] made on the new turn.

### Continuous Costs
Certain [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] may have ongoing or continuous Stamina costs. These types of [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] provide constant benefits but come with a regular expense that is paid at the start of each of the character's turns.

If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] is performing a continuous action, they may end that [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] at any time, including outside of their own turn, at no cost.

### Quick Actions
Some situations may require an immediate response from the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]], even outside of their turn. These are called quick [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]]. Performing a quick [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] requires twice as much Stamina as a regular action.

Any [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] may be used as a quick [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] and it is encouraged for [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] to be creative with how and when they spend their Stamina.

### Maximum Stamina
A character's maximum Stamina may be decreased due to certain circumstances or [[Core Rules/Conditions\|conditions]]. Should a character's maximum Stamina reach 0, that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] suffers the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Unconscious\|unconscious]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]].
