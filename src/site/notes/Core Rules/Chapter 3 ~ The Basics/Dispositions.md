A Disposition in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] is a [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] feelings, temperament, or inclination towards another Character, Certain Objects, Concepts, Places, or Ideas. Anything that can be thought of can have a Disposition.

Dispositions can be caused or created on the fly as well as foundational to how a Character thinks from a life of experience.
>[!note]
>In theory, a Character's entire personality and background can be represented in a series of Dispositions.

Dispositions consist of 3 parts:
## Target
The "thing" that the Character as a Disposition towards. This can be anything, specific or broad. 
>[!Examples]
>A specific Character, a group of Characters, a certain ideal, a collection of ideas, a specific God, Gods in general, specific qualities about themselves, themselves in general, or *spiders*...
## Feeling
This is what that Character feels about the Target. This can be any emotion, stance, or reaction.
>[!Examples]
>Loving, Caring, Friendly, Passive, Neutral, Uncaring, Frightened, Terrified, Disgusted, Dislike, Aggressive, Hostile, Hateful, Awe inducing, Cringe Worthy, or Pants Ruining.
## Reason
This is the "Why" to the "What" and "How". This can be as detailed or simple as desired. Though, it is simplest to create a short sentence that can be easily referenced.
>[!Examples]
>- It bit me once.
>- I've never seen them before.
>- That goes against everything I believe in.
>- They betrayed me, I can't forgive them.
>- They screw up EVERY TIME!
>- I am allergic.

## Changing Dispositions
Dispositions can change for any reason at any time. Dispositions may even change in a cascade if they are set up complexly enough.

As Dispositions directly affect how a Character behaves, A Character can attempt to change or create a disposition in another Character, even if the change is temporary. Such as making another Character frightened of them, preaching the gospel of their savior, making another Character see them as a friend. Anything that can be thought of can be used to make and change a disposition.
