Stamina in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] is the will and fight to survive. To push forward and take action. It is fuel and energy.

The maximum amount of Stamina [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] can have is represented by doubling the number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] in their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects#â™  Spirit\|Spirit Aspect]]. If a Character has 0 Ranks in their Spirit Aspect, then their Stamina is 1.
>[!Example]
>A Character with a Spirit Aspect that has 3 Ranks, 3 + 3 = 6, gives that Character 6 Stamina.

Stamina is consumed whenever a Character uses [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] or whenever a Character chooses to consume Stamina when taking [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]].

Stamina is reset back to its maximum value at the beginning of the Character's turn.
### Continuous Costs
Certain [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] may have ongoing or continuous Stamina costs. These types of [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] provide constant benefits but come with a regular expense that is paid at the start of each of the character's turns.

If a Character is performing a continuous action, they may end that [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] at any time, including outside of their own turn, at no cost.
### Quick Actions
Some situations may require an immediate response from the Character, even outside of their turn. These are called quick [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]]. Performing a quick [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] requires twice as much Stamina as a regular action.

Any [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] may be used as a quick [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] and it is encouraged for [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] to be creative with how and when they spend their Stamina.
### Maximum Stamina
A Character's maximum Stamina may be decreased due to certain circumstances or [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Conditions\|Conditions]]. Whenever a Character reaches 0 Maximum Stamina and would be brought below 0, they suffer the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Condition List/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Conditions\|Condition]] have negative Maximum Stamina. That Character suffers 1 rank of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Condition List/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Conditions\|Condition]] for every rank below 0.
