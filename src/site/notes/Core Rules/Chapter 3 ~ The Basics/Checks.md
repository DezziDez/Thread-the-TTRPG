A Check is whenever [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] need to resolve a conflict, solve a problem, or overcome a challenge.

A Check is performed by taking the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects\|Aspects]] and adding the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] of those Aspects together.

>[!Example]
A **Body+Mind** Check where Body has 2 Ranks and Mind has 3 Ranks would be 5.

[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] making the Check may then draw up to that many cards from their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/The Deck and Discard#Deck\|Deck]]. The Character may stop drawing at any time up to the amount able. When the Character stops drawing, they must use that last card drawn for the Check. Placing all drawn Cards into their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/The Deck and Discard#Discard\|Discard]] after the Check is over.

The value of the card as shown in [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Playing Cards\|Playing Cards]] determines the success or failure of the Check. In the event of a tie, use the card previously drawn, continuously, until there is an outcome. If there is no previous card, the value is considered to be 0.

## World
A Check can be made against the environment or world. In this case, [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] determines the difficulty of the Check by choosing a fitting value to beat, generally between 1 and 13, though the number can be higher.
## Contests
A Contest is a type of Check that occurs when two Characters are challenging each other. When there is a Contest, the two Characters draw cards in secret and reveal their cards simultaneously.2
## Jokers
Whenever a [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Playing Cards#Jokers\|Joker]] is drawn, the Character must stop drawing and use that card. The effects of Jokers on Checks are as follows:
>+🃏:  Either use the previously drawn card or draw one more card if able, the value of that card is doubled. Likely causing the Check to succeed.
>-🃏: Draw no more cards, the Check fails.
