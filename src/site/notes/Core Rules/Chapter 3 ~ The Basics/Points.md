Points are the representation of power, progression, and skill for any character. They are used to increase the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects\|Aspects]] or to purchase new [[Draft 2/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] during a [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]].
## Unspent Points
A Character gains Unspent Points at the end of every session or at the end of a large event. The [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] awards Character with Points based on their judgement. Generally, at least 1 Point should be awarded to each Character at the end of each session.

After a Character uses Unspent Points, they become Spent Points.
## Spent Points
The number of Spent Points a Character has can be used to quickly determine how strong a Character is. This can be used for balancing [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Events\|Events]] with other [[Character\|Characters]] or just as a quick representation of Character growth.
