## Deck
All [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] possess a Deck of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Playing Cards\|Playing Cards]] that determines the ability and energy of that Character.

Cards can be drawn from the deck for [[Draft 2/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Checks\|Checks]]. Once drawn, a card is placed into the Discard.

Once a Character is out of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Playing Cards\|Playing Cards]] in their Deck. They automatically fail any Checks and cannot use Skills that require the Character to draw any cards.
## Discard
All Characters possess a Discard, whether its empty or full. Discarded cards cannot be drawn as they are used.

Before any cards are placed from the Discard into the Deck, the Discard must be shuffled to ensure that the cards placed into the Deck are random. The Deck is then shuffled to move their position in the Deck.
