## Deck
All [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] possess a Deck of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Randomness\|Cards]]. This Deck of cards represents the Character's long term energy and luck.

Cards can be drawn from the Deck for [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Perks\|Perks]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Checks\|Checks]]. Once drawn, a card is placed into the Discard.

Once a Character is out of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Randomness\|Cards]] in their Deck. They automatically fail any Checks and cannot use Skills that require the Character to draw any cards.
## Discard
All Characters possess a Discard, whether its empty or full. Discarded cards cannot be drawn as they are used.
## Inserting
Whenever cards are placed from the Discard into the Deck, the Discard is shuffled randomly to ensure that the cards placed into the Deck are random. The Deck is then shuffled to move their position in the Deck.
## Burn
Burn is described as discarding one card from a Character's Deck.
## Resting
Characters are able to insert cards back into their Deck after resting.
#### Full-Rest
After completing a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]], the Character Inserts all cards from their Discard into their Deck.
#### Partial-Rest
After completing a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting#Partial-Rest\|Partial-Rest]], the Character inserts a number of cards equal to their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] in [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects#♠ Spirit\|Spirit]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects#♣ Luck\|Luck]].
#### Rest Burn
Whenever a Character chooses to take [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] or performs [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Checks\|Checks]] that Burns a card during a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting\|Rest]], then the cards burned would not be restored at the end of the rest.

# The Weaver's Bottomless Deck
[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] uses a different kind of deck to represent all [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] not controlled by [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Players\|The Players]]. Whenever [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] needs to Burn card for another Character, The Weaver may place the card at the bottom of the deck instead of a Discard. The Weaver shuffles this deck every so often to ensure there is no repetition.

This is due to the fact that The Weaver may have to control many Characters at once and having a Deck for each of those Characters is very impractical.
