## Deck
All [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] possess a Deck of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Randomness\|Cards]]. This Deck of cards represents the Character's long term energy and luck.

Cards can be drawn from the Deck for [[Draft 2/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Checks\|Checks]]. Once drawn, a card is placed into the Discard.

Once a Character is out of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Randomness\|Cards]] in their Deck. They automatically fail any Checks and cannot use Skills that require the Character to draw any cards.
## Discard
All Characters possess a Discard, whether its empty or full. Discarded cards cannot be drawn as they are used.
## Inserting
Whenever cards are placed from the Discard into the Deck, the Discard is shuffled randomly to ensure that the cards placed into the Deck are random. The Deck is then shuffled to move their position in the Deck.
## Burn
Burn is described as discarding one card from a Characters Deck.
## Resting
Characters are able to Insert cards back into their Deck after resting.
#### Full-Rest
After completing a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]], the Character Inserts all cards from their Discard into their Deck.
#### Half-Rest
After completing a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting#Half-Rest\|Half-Rest]], the Character inserts a number of cards equal to their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] in [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects#♠ Spirit\|Spirit]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects#♣ Luck\|Luck]].
