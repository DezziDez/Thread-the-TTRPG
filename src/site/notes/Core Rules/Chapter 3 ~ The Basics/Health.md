Health in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] is what keep all [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] alive. It is life force and will to live.

The maximum amount of Health a Character can have is represented by doubling the number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] in the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects#â™¥ Body\|Body Aspect]].
>[!Example]
>A Character with a Body Aspect that has 3 Ranks, 3 + 3 = 6, gives that Character 6 Health.

Health is reduced mainly when a Character takes [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]]. This is generally avoided by consuming [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]].
## The Edge
The Edge refers to the line between life and death for a Character. This line is right when a Character reaches 0 Health.
#### Over the Edge

At the beginning of a Character's [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]] that is Over the Edge, they lose another Health. Furthering their state.
