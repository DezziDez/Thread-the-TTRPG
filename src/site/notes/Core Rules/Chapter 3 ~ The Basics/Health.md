Health in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] is what keep all [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] alive. It is life force and will to live.

The maximum amount of Health a Character can have is represented by doubling the number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] in their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects#♥ Body\|Body Aspect]]. If a Character has 0 Ranks in their Body Aspect, then their Health is 1.
>[!Example]
>A Character with a Body Aspect that has 3 Ranks, 3 + 3 = 6, gives that Character 6 Health.

Health is reduced mainly when a Character takes [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]]. This is generally avoided by consuming [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]].
## The Edge
The Edge refers to the line between life and death for a Character. This line is right when a Character reaches 0 Health.
#### Over the Edge
Whenever a Character reaches 0 Health and would be brought below 0, they are Over the Edge and have negative Health. The Over the Edge Character has their maximum [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] reduced for every point of negative health they suffer.

At the beginning of a Character's [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]] that is Over the Edge, they lose another Health falling further into the negative.
##### Death
Once a Character has more negative Health than their maximum Health, they are Dead.
## Resting
Whenever [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting\|Rests]] they regain some amount of Health.
#### Full-Rest
After completing a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]], the Character regains an amount of missing Health equal to their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] in their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects#♥ Body\|Body Aspect]].
#### Partial-Rest
After completing a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting#Partial-Rest\|Partial-Rest]], the Character regains 1 missing Health.
