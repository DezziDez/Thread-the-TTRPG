When a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] takes the [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|Action]] they must determine if they are within Range.

An attacking [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] is within range depending on the maximum range of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|skill]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Item Property Lists/Basic Properties/Weapon\|Weapon]] being used. The [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] may allow the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] to attack outside of this maximum range in certain situations or with an [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Ability Checks\|ability check]] to succeed.
