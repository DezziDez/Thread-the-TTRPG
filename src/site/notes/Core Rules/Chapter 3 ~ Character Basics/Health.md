Health are the life force and ability to survive.

The maximum amount of Health a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] has is easily represented by taking two [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Dice]] equal to the value of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] Vitality.
- For example, if a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] has 3 ranks in Vitality, then that [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] represents their Health with 2d6 set to their maximum value, 12 is the maximum Health in this case. Subtracting Health is done by decreasing the value on the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Dice\|Dice]].

Health is reduced mainly when a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] takes [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Damage\|Damage]]. This is generally avoided by consuming [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]].


## Dying
If a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character's]] Health would be reduced to 0, the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] suffers 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition for every point of remaining [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Damage\|Damage]] that would reduce the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character's]] Health below 0. [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] cannot be below 0 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Health\|Health]].

- **Clarification:** This does mean that a Character can be at exactly 0 Health without suffering the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition.

After a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] has gained enough ranks of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition that the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] will be made [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] due to a lack of maximum [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]]. The dying [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] must now make [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Ability Check Combinations/Vitality+Will\|Vitality+Will]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] at the end of their turn against the number of ranks of [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Conditions\|condition]] they have in order to remain alive.

A [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] that succeeds this [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Ability Checks\|Ability Check]] 3 times total becomes stable. A [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] that fails 3 times total **dies**.

A stable [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] no longer has to make [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Ability Check Combinations/Vitality+Will\|Vitality+Will]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] and will have all of their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Conditions\|condition]] removed **only** after at least a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Resting#Break\|Break]].

If a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] reaches 0 ranks of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition, the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] becomes Stable automatically and remains at 0 Health.

## Overkill
If a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] were to be reduced to 0 Health and have enough remaining [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Damage\|Damage]] to equal to twice the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] maximum Health, that [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] would die instantly.
