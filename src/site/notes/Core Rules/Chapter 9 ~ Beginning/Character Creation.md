## Character Deck
All [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] have a starting point, and that starting point is the Character Deck.
As opposed to most similar table-top role playing games, [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] does not use a Character Sheet and instead uses a smaller Deck of cards that represents the Functions, [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects\|Aspects]], [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Perks\|Perks]], and [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] the Character has available to them.

Basic versions of these Cards will be available as a downloadable set of SVG files for printing.
## Starting Stats
All Characters begin with all their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects\|Aspects]] at [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Rank]] 0 and have no [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Perks\|Perks]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]]. A blank slate. Then, the Character is given a number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Points\|Points]] as determined by [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]]. These points are to be spent on any Perks the Character wants within reason.

>[!Note]
>It is a good idea for each [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Players\|Player]] to talk to [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] about their [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] and get their approval or advice before finalization.

[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] may also give the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] starting [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Perks\|Perks]] without cost due to the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Setting\|setting]]. Such as giving all the Perks necessary to be a Human.
## Point Allocation
This is the trickiest part of Character Creation. Where all the points are spent. Due to the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects\|Aspect]] requirements of [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Perks\|Perks]] this step can be a lot of back and forth. It is generally a good idea to start with a base number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] in the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects\|Aspects]] that most accurately represent your Character. Then tweak this setup as needed.
## Flaws
A Character may start with some flaws. This is to be discussed with [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]]. Then, once Flaws are chosen, additional points are allocated to the Character.
## Dispositions
The [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Dispositions\|Dispositions]] of a Character allow the building of personality, history, and background. This is where creativity is heavily encouraged.
## Objects
A Character may start with [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] in their [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Inventory\|Inventory]]. These Objects, their [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Properties\|Properties]], and values are determined by [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] and are heavily influenced by the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Setting\|setting]].
## Finalization
Once all Aspects, Perks/Flaws, Dispositions, Objects, and calculations for [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] have been made. The Character is ready!
