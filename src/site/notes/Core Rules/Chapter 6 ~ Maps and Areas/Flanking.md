[[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] can position themselves such that they make it difficult for the defending [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] to protect themselves. [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] flanking a defending [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] gain a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] against the defending [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] for melee [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attacks]].

When two [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] are attacking a defending [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] within 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tile]] range, draw a line between the two attacking [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]]. If that line intersects the defending character, the attacking [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] are flanking the defending character. 

A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] cannot flank a defending [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] that is 2 or more [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Sizes\|Sizes]] larger than them.

A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] cannot flank a single [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] more than once. Even if there are multiple attacking [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] that would be considered flanking.
