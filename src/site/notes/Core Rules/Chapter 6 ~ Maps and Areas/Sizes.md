Every [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] has a size. The size of a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] determines the number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]] they take up on a map and in physical space.

A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] increases by 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|tile]] for every size category above Medium and decreases by 1/2 a [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|tile]] for every category below Medium. There is no hard limit to how large or small a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Character]] can be, but practically [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Character Basics/Character\|Characters]] can be too small or too large to manage for the game.

The names of the sizes beyond Small, Medium, and Large have no real meaning and can easily be changed.
