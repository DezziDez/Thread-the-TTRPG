[[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Tiles\|Tiles]] in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Threads/Thread\|Thread]] are Hexagons (Hexes/Hex) or Squares. A tile is used to represent distance and size in most TTRPGs that have a battle map, top-down depictions of environments to represent physical interactions.

A hex based battle map is considered to be much more accurate when it comes to measuring distances. This comes at the cost of being confusing for most people to look at and quickly understand. Representing the [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Sizes\|Sizes]] of objects or [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]] is also a challenge.

A square based battle map is less accurate but is much easier to understand for most people. This is also the standard for other TTRPGs and premade battle maps. It is up to the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] to determine if the campaign will be using Square or Hexes for Tiles.

[[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Threads/Thread\|Thread]] assumes that:
1 Tile = 1 Meter (For Metric)
or
1 Tile = 3 Feet (For Imperial)

Regardless of the physical measurements being used, **Tiles** will be used for all measurements in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Threads/Thread\|Thread]].
