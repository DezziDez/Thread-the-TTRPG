Some [[Core Rules/Skills\|Skills]] or [[Core Rules/Items\|Items]] provide protection against certain kinds of [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]]. For instance, Armor aids in resisting [[Core Rules/Damage Tyoes/Physical\|Physical]] [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]]. The level of protection provided by the source is determined by its [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]]. When a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] takes [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] they have a resistance to, they roll 1 die, according to the [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]], and subtract the rolled amount from the [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] taken.

If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] possesses multiple sources of resistance to a specific type of [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]], the [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] of protection increases by 1 from the highest ranking source. For example, a [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] 2 and a [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] 3 Resistance source would result in a [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] 4 Resistance.
