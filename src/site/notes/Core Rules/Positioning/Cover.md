Characters can take cover behind objects to protect themselves. The cover itself though can take the damage and once the cover is destroyed the protection is gone.

#### Full Cover
The Character is sufficiently covered to not be targeted or directly seen within line of sight.
Areas of Effect that do not move around corners cannot hit the Character.

#### Half Cover
At least half of the Character is covered
Characters targeting the partially covered Character suffer a [[Core Rules/Abilities/Advantage and Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]].
