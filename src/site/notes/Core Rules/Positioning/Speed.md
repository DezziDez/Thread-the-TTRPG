All [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] have a speed stat that determines how far that Character can move on solid ground.

A character's speed is determined by adding together their rank in Agility twice and their rank in Might twice. For example, if a character has 2 [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] (1d4) in Agility and 3 [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] (1d6) in Might, the character has 2+2 = 4 (1d4 = 4) and 3+3 = 6 (1d6 = 6) then 4+6=10 speed. That character can then move 10 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Tiles\|Tiles]] when they used the [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] action.

Whenever a character wants to move through a more difficult environment such as swimming, climbing, or moving through bramble. That character suffers 1 rank of [[Core Rules/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] until the character stops moving, halving the Characters movement or more if they already have ranks of slowed.
