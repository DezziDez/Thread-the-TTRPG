When a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] takes the [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] action they must determine if they are within Melee range or within Firing Range.

### Melee Range
An attacking Character is within melee range if they are within 1 tile of the defending Character.

### Firing Range
An attacking Character is within firing range depending on the maximum range of the skill or weapon being used. The [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] may allow the character to attack outside of this maximum range in certain situations or with an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|ability check]] to succeed.
