When a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] takes the [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] they must determine if they are within Range.

An attacking [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] is within range depending on the maximum range of the [[Core Rules/Skills\|skill]] or [[Core Rules/Items/Properties/Basic Properties/Weapon\|weapon]] being used. The [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] may allow the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] to attack outside of this maximum range in certain situations or with an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|ability check]] to succeed.
