There are many types of light, but the light types that will be encountered most often by any character are as follows from brightest to darkest:

Blinding:
- This type of light is so bright that it is blinding. Blinding light inflicts the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Blinded\|Blinded]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] on any character that is within its radius. This type of light is usually brief and only blinds characters temporarily.

Bright:
- Bright light is extremely clear light that fills large areas and adds contrast, such as sunlight. Characters seeing through bright light gain an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Advantage and Disadvantage\|advantage]] on vision based ability checks.

Normal:
- Normal lighting is the average amount of light any character would experience inside a building with light sources or natural lighting from windows.

Low:
- Low lighting is difficult to see in, there is some light but not much. Characters suffer a [[Core Rules/Abilities/Advantage and Disadvantage\|disadvantage]] to vision based ability checks while trying to see through it.

Darkness:
- There is absolutely no light here. Characters attempting to see through darkness suffer the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Blinded\|Blinded]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]].
