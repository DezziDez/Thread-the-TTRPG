Tiles in Thread are Hexagons (Hexes/Hex) or Squares. A tile is used to represent distance and size in most TTRPGs that have a battle map, top-down depictions of environments to represent physical interactions.

A hex based battle map is considered to be much more accurate when it comes to measuring distances. This comes at the cost of being confusing for most people to look at and quickly understand. Representing the [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|Sizes]] of objects or Characters is also a challenge.

A square based battle map is less accurate but is much easier to understand for most people. This is also the standard for other TTRPGs and premade battle maps. It is up to the GM to determine if the campaign will be using Square or Hexes for Tiles.

Thread assumes that:
1 Tile = 1 Meter (For Metric)
or
1 Tile = 3 Feet (For Imperial)

Regardless of the physical measurements being used, **Tiles** will be used for all measurements in Thread.
