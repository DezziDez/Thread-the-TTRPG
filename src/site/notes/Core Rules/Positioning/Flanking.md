Characters can position themselves such that they make it difficult for the defending Character to protect themselves. Characters flanking a defending Character gain an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Advantage and Disadvantage\|Advantage]] against the defending Character for melee [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attacks]].

When two characters are attacking a defending character within melee range, draw a line between the two attacking characters. If that line intersects the defending character, the attacking characters are flanking the defending character. 

A character cannot flank a defending character that is 2 or more [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|Sizes]] larger than them.

A character cannot flank a single character more than once. Even if there are multiple attacking characters that would be considered flanking.
