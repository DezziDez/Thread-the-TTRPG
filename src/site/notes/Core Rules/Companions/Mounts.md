If another character wishes to ride another or be carried by another character. That character must be at least 1 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|size]] smaller than the character being ridden.

If multiple characters wish to ride another, then the ridden character must be 1 size larger for each additional character of the same [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|size]].

For example, if a character is Huge, then they can carry 2 Medium characters.

Depending on the character being ridden, they may be considered a [[Core Rules/Companions/Companions\|companion]] such as a horse. Though more intelligent characters may be independent and would have their own turns.

Characters riding another character do not consume movement when the ridden character moves.
