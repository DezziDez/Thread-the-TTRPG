Characters can have any number of companions or familiars at their command or control. From animals, strange creatures, or even people.

If a character is under the control or command of another character, that character's initiative is always the same as the controlling characters unless otherwise stated.

Begging of turn effects trigger at the same time as well as end of turn effects. The controlling character can choose which actions from which characters happen in which order. Allowing for direct coordination and teamwork.
