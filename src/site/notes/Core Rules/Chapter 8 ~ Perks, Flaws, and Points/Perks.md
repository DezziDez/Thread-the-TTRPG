## What are Perks
Perks are the primary access to power, skill, and ability in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]]. There is no standard way to play Thread. Instead, any character can mix and match any perks that they meet the requirements for. Creating unique [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] of any kind.
## Purchasing Perks
Whenever a [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Character]] takes a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]], that Character may spend [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Points\|Points]] on Perks.

Every Perk has a list of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Aspects\|Aspects]] that must be of the specified [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Rank]] in order for the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Character]] to purchase the Perk.
Perks also have a Point cost. In order to purchase the Perk, the Character must spend that many [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Points\|Points]].
## Perk Categories
Every Perk is sorted into three categories. Trait, Active, and Passive.
#### Trait
A Trait is a type of Perk that is innate or part of a Character. Generally, Traits only able to be chosen during [[Core Rules/Chapter 9 ~ Beginning/Character Creation\|Character Creation]].
>[!Examples]
>Claws, Visions, Number of Limbs, Base [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Sizes\|Size]], and Wings
#### Active
An Active Perk is a type of Perk that must be intentionally used by the Character. The effects of the Perk do not happen automatically and do not have a trigger. These kinds of Perks are usually [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]].
#### Passive
A Passive Perk is a type of Perk that happens automatically or has some kind of constant use. These Perks are general buffs to the Character or are triggered on their own in some way.
## Upgrades
Some Perks may be able to be upgraded over time. A Perk that can be upgraded may have a greater Aspect requirement. 

Upgrading a Perk may cost a flat number of Points, such as when upgrading a perk slightly increases the effectiveness of a Perk. The number of Points to upgrade may also scale with the number of upgrades already taken, such as when a Perks upgrades significantly increase the effectiveness of the perk.
#### Types
Upgrades, like the base Perks, have types. These types describe how the upgrade functions. The type can be a combination of, Single, Repeating, and/or Choice.
###### Single
A single upgrade cannot be taken again or another choice cannot be made.
###### Repeating
A repeating upgrade may be taken multiple times. The cost and Aspect increases must be met for each upgrade.
###### Choice
A choice upgrade gives mutliple options to choose from that greatly alter how the Perk functions. Once an upgrade is made, it does not normally restrict future upgrades or additional options.
