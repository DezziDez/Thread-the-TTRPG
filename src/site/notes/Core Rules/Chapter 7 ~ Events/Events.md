An event is anything that might need careful planning or swift [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Actions\|Action]] by the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]] involved. An event is broken down into [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Rounds\|Rounds]] and the length of an event is only as long as the number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Rounds\|Rounds]] it takes before the event ends.

Common events are combat, timed challenges/puzzles, complex social encounters, or dangerous environments.

An event can be declared by the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] at any time for any reason.
