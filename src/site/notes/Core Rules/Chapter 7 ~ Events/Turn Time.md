In [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Threads/Thread\|Thread]], there is a concept known as Turn Time. This is where most crucial time-sensitive [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Actions\|Actions]] occur. Turn Time can be entered at any time by the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] declaring an [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Events\|event]].

When an [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Events\|event]] is declared time slows into [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Turns\|Turns]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Rounds\|Rounds]]. All [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Players\|Players]] vote to decide which [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] goes first. After that [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] ends their turn, the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Players\|player]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] controlling that [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] chooses which [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] goes next. Each [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] can only be given 1 turn each [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Rounds\|Round]]. This then continues until all [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Characters]] in the [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Events\|event]] have had 1 turn. 

Once the last [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Rounds\|round]] finishes their turn, the beginning of the next round starts, and all [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Players\|Players]] vote on the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] that goes first on the new [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Rounds\|round]].

### Hidden Characters
If there are characters in an [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Events\|event]] that the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Players\|Players]] are not aware of or is hidden, then the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] may choose for one of those [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|characters]] to go instead of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Players\|Players]] vote on if a vote takes place.
