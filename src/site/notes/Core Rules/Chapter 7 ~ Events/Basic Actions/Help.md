### Description
A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] can provide aid to a roll to make the roll more likely to succeed or be more effective instead of making more than one roll. 

#### Using help
- The [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] helps one other [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] with their next roll. The other [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] then gains a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] on that roll.
- A [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] cannot gain a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] from the Help [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Actions\|action]] more than once in a roll.
- Using the Help [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Actions\|action]] on any [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] with the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition also removes 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition from the character. The Help [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Events/Actions\|Action]] may be used multiple times to remove multiple ranks of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Mechanics/Conditions\|Condition]] on characters.

### Notes
Help can be given on any roll as long as the circumstances make sense and the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ Characters/Character\|Character]] can actually help.
