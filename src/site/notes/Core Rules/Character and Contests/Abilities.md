Whenever a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] spends [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Rank Points\|Rank Points]] during a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]] they may choose to rank up an ability instead of purchasing [[Core Rules/Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]].

Abilities cost a number of [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Rank Points\|Rank Points]] equal to the rank being purchased. Abilities must be increased in [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ranks\|Ranks]] in order.

For example, if a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] wishes to increase Agility from rank 2 to rank 3, then that [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] must spend 3 rank points.
