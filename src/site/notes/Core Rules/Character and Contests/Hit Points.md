Hit Points are the life force and ability to survive.

The maximum amount of Stamina a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] has is easily represented by taking two dice equal to the value of the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] Vitality.
- For example, if a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] has 3 ranks in Vitality, then that [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] represents their Hit Points with 2d6 set to their maximum value, 12 is the maximum Hit Points in this case. Subtracting hit points is done by decreasing the value on the dice.

Hit Points are reduced mainly when a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] takes [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]]. This is generally avoided by consuming [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Stamina\|Stamina]].

## Dying
If a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] hit points would reach 0 hit points, the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] suffers 1 rank of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition for every point of remaining [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] that would reduce the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] hit points below 0. [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] cannot be below 0 [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Hit Points\|Hit Points]].

If a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] reaches 0 ranks of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition, the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] regains 1 hit point.

After a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] has gained enough ranks of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] condition that the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] will be made unconscious due to a lack of maximum [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Stamina\|Stamina]]. The dying [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] must now make Vitality+Will [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] at the end of their turn against the number of ranks of [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]] they have in order to remain alive.

A dying and unconscious [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] that succeeds this ability check 3 times becomes stable. A stable [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] no longer has to make Vitality+Will [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] and will have all of their [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ranks\|Ranks]] of the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]] removed after a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Resting#Break\|Break]]. A dying and unconscious [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] that fails 3 times dies.

## Overkill
If a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] were to drop to 0 hit points and have enough remaining [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] to equal to twice the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] maximum hit points, that [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] would die instantly.
