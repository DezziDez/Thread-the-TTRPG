Some ability checks may need to be done repetitively over time. Such as continuously watching for traps or reading another creatures emotions during a conversation.

This is when a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] would use their Average Check. This is an [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ability Checks\|Ability Check]] that does not require a roll. The average of the check would be used. Which is half of the die rounded up to the nearest whole number. The average can also be found on the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ranks\|Ranks]] table.

For example, if a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] has 3 [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Insight and 2 [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Intellect, and wanted to detect if a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] is lying during an interrogation repetitively, they would use the average of 4+3=7 instead of rolling.

If a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] has a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] or [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Boon and Bane\|Bane]] they would simply move that die to it's maximum or minimum respectively instead of taking the average.

For the same example, if the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] has an Boon, they would use 4+4=8 instead of 7. If the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] has a Bane, they would use 4+1=5 instead of 7.
