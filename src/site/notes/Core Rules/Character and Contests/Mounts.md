If another [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] wishes to ride another or be carried by another character. That [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] must be at least 1 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Sizes\|size]] smaller than the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] being ridden.

If multiple [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] wish to ride another, then the ridden [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] must be 1 size larger for each additional [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] of the same [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Sizes\|size]].

For example, if a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] is Huge, then they can carry 2 Medium [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]].

Depending on the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] being ridden, they may be considered a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Companions\|companion]] such as a horse. Though more intelligent [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] may be independent and would have their own turns.

[[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] riding another [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] do not consume movement when the ridden [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] moves.
