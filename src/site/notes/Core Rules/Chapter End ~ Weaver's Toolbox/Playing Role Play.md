Not all [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Players\|Players]] can or want to play out exactly what their [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] say or do. Because of this disconnect between [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Players\|The Players]] and their [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] there are [[Core Rules/Chapter 8 ~ Perks, Flaws, and Points/Perks\|Perks]] and [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Checks\|Checks]] that can be used to aid in changing the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Dispositions\|Dispositions]] of other [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]].

These options should be used and it is encouraged for [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Players\|The Players]] to acquire these options regardless of their real life ability. This flexibility allows anyone to have fun in the game.
