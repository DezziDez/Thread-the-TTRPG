Some [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] are weak by themselves but strong in numbers. This may lead to groups or swarms of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] of the same type. In this case, the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] would all act on the same [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|turn]], usually all taking the same [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]].

Groups have two main functions that are different from individual [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]]:
- [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]]: All the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] of all the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] in the group is added together in a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] pool.
- [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]]: The group has a hit point threshold equal to the maximum [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]] of an individual Character in the group.

If the group were to take [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]], repeatedly reduce the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]] by the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]] threshold of the group until the threshold can no longer be met. The number of times this is able to be repeated, that many [[Character\|Characters]] in the group have their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]] and maximum [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] reduced to 0 and are removed from the group.

Groups of the same Character can split and merge at will. Groups that merge do not gain the additional [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] to their pool until the beginning of their next [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]].
### Resistance
If the group has [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resistances\|Resistances]] to certain [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]] types, [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resistances\|resistance]] is only rolled once for each instance of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]].

For example: An [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Attack\|Attack]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] from another Character would only trigger one roll of [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resistances\|Resistance]]. While an [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Area of Effect\|Area of Effect]] would trigger a [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Resistances\|Resistance]] for each Character hit.
