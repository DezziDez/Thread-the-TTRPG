Some [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] are weak by themselves but strong in numbers. This may lead to groups or swarms of [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] of the same type. In this case, the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] would all act on the same [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]], usually all taking the same [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]].
## Group Stats
Groups have two main functions that are different from individual [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]]:
- [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]]: All the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] of all the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] in the group is added together in a [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] pool.
- [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]]: The group has a Health threshold equal to the maximum [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]] of an individual Character in the group.
## Taking Damage
If the Group takes [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]], reduce the [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]] of the group by the damage taken. Whenever the threshold is met, a Character in the Group is removed. This occurs repeatedly even from a single source of Damage.

Groups of the same Character can split and merge at will. Groups that merge do not gain the additional [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] to their pool until the beginning of their next [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]].
