Traveling long distances in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] can be fast paced and interesting for all involved.
Whenever going from one point of interest to another, [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] must determine the distance ranking of that destination just like [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Ranges\|Ranges]].

[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] must first determine a close distances for the setting and world. Then, Ranges farther than close are twice as far for every additional Range.
## Challenges
For every [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Rank]] of Range between two point, [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/The Weaver\|The Weaver]] must determine an equivalent number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Events\|Events]] to occur over that travel period.

These Events can be anything from combat with wild animals, Challenging environments, Role Play with other Characters and Travelers. All that is important is that these Events and Challenges are determined before hand to give and exciting and interesting feeling to the travel.
