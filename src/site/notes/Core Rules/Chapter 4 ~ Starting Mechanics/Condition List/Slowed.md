## Description
To be in a position where the ability to move through the world is heavily reduced. Such as when swimming, climbing, or moving through rough terrain.
## Effect
1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Steps\|Step]] of your Movement requires 2 Steps worth of Movement. Quick steps are affected.

>[!Example]
>If a Character is Slowed and takes the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Move#Basic Move\|Basic Move]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] then that Character can only move 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Steps\|Step]] instead of 2. Since a [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions#Quick Step\|Quick Step]] is only 1 Step, that gives a total of 3 available movement and the last Step is wasted.
## Additional Ranks
The amount of steps worth of movement required for you to move 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Steps\|Step]] increases by 1.
## Greater Effect
If you cannot move due having too many [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] of Slowed and are Flying or Swimming, you [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Falling\|Fall]].
