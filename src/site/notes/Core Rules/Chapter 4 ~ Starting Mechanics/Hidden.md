## What is being Hidden
Being Hidden means that a Character is unseen and their **exact** location is unknown to other [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]]. Hidden Characters are only Hidden to other Characters that cannot locate them, they are not Hidden from Characters that can locate them.
## Pointing out a Hidden Character
A Character can use the [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Communicate#Basic Communication\|Basic Communication]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Action]] to point out the location of another Character, this does not make the exact location of the a Character known.
## Hidden Effects
A Character that is Hidden cannot be targeted by [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] of other Characters.
Hidden Characters are still effected by [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Area of Effect\|Areas of Effect]].
