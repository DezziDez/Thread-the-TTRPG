Conditions are effects on [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]].

Each condition has a description of the effect. The duration of a condition is specified when the Condition is inflicted on a Character.

When a condition is removed or ends, all effects of a condition are also removed except [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]] caused by the condition.
## Ranks
Conditions may be able to have [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]]. These Ranks are increased when the condition is inflicted more than once.
These Ranks apply greater effects to the Character that is being inflicted.
