## Sustaining
Most [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] need to eat and drink or consume a form of fuel to keep going each day. This is known as Sustenance and each Character requires 1 unit of Sustenance each day for each [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Sizes\|Size]] of the Character.

If a Character goes a day without consuming the necessary amount of Sustenance, then that Character suffers 1 [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Rank]] of the [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Condition List/Exhausted\|Exhausted]] [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Conditions\|Condition]]
## Breathing
Most [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] need to Breath. There are some situation where a Character cannot or should do so.

If a Character needs to Breath and holds their breath, their [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina#Maximum Stamina\|Maximum Stamina]] is reduced by 1 at the end of their [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]]. This continues until a Character takes a [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]] to breath and regain their lost Maximum Stamina at the end of their [[Core Rules/Chapter 5 ~ Events and Actions/Turns\|Turn]].
