Some [[Draft 2/Chapter 8 ~ Skills and Flaws/Skills\|Skills]] or [[Draft 2/Chapter 5 ~ Items and Crafting/Items\|Items]] provide protection against certain kinds of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]]. This is known as a source of Resistance.
## Ranks
A Character may have a number of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]] of Resistance to each [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage#Damage Types\|Type]] of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Damage\|Damage]].
For each Rank of Resistance, the amount of Damage taken by that type is reduced by 1.

Sources of Resistance always add together linearly.

>[!Example]
>A Character with a Skill that grants 2 Ranks of Physical Resistance and Armor that grants 4 Ranks of Physical Resistance has 6 Physical Resistance total.
