[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] can have any number of companions or familiars at their command or control. From animals, strange creatures, or even people.

If a Character is under the control or command of another character, that character's initiative is always the same as the controlling [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] unless otherwise stated.

Begging of turn effects trigger at the same time as well as end of turn effects. The controlling Character can choose which [[Draft 2/Chapter 7 ~ Events and Actions/Actions\|Actions]] from which Characters happen in which order. Allowing for direct coordination and teamwork.
