Damage is categorized into four distinct types: [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Damage Types/Physical\|Physical]], [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Damage Types/Temperate\|Temperate]], [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Damage Types/Chemical\|Chemical]], and [[Core Rules/Chapter 4 ~ Starting Mechanics/Damage Types/Mental\|Mental]]. 

When a Character takes Damage from a Damage source, the Character must choose to either expend an equal amount of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] to avoid the Damage or to not expend [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] and lose an equal amount of [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]]. If the Character has no [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Stamina\|Stamina]] left. Then the Character has no choice but to lose [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Health\|Health]].

A Character can also use [[Draft 2/Chapter 4 ~ General Mechanics/Resistances\|Resistances]] to avoid Damage entirely.
