## Rest Definition
A period of light activity, called a Rest, is used by [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] to regain energy and wits. During this time, a Character can perform low-stress activities like crafting or bartering but not high-stress ones like combat or intense mental tasks.

There are two types of rests:
#### Full-Rest
A Full-Rest takes a full day, (usually 24 hours)
#### Partial-Rest
A Partial-Rest, takes at least 6 hours.
