If another Character wishes to ride another or be carried by another character. That Character must be at least 1 [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Sizes\|size]] smaller than the Character being ridden.

If multiple [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] wish to ride another, then the ridden Character must be 1 size larger for each additional Character of the same [[Draft 2/Chapter 6 ~ Maps and Areas/Sizes\|size]].

For example, if a Character is Huge, then they can carry 2 Medium [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]].

[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] riding another Character do not consume movement when the ridden Character moves as the Character is taken with the ridden Character.
