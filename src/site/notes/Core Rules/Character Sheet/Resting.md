## Rest Definition
A period of light activity, called a Rest, is used by [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] to regain energy and wits. During this time, a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can perform low-stress activities like crafting or bartering but not high-stress ones like combat or intense mental tasks.

There are three types of rests: Full-Rest, Half-Rest, and Break. 
Higher levels of rest are counted towards any requirements for lower levels of rest.

### Full-Rest
A Full-Rest takes a full day, (usually 24 hours)
[[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] can spend [[Core Rules/Rank Points\|Rank Points]], restore [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Hit Points\|Hit Points]] to their maximum.

### Half-Rest
A Half-Rest, takes at least 6 hours.
[[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] can restore Hit Points equal to their [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Vitality.

[[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] have a number of half rests available to use equal to their ranks in Will. Once a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has used all of their Half-Rests they must take a Full-Rest to regain them.

### Break
A Break, taking at least one hour.
A break has no direct benefits except to take time to shrug off certain conditions, effects, or to refresh skills.

### **NOT** Resting
All [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] must take at least one Half-Rest every full day or else they will suffer one rank of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Exhausted\|Exhausted]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]].
