Hit Points are the life force and ability to survive.

The maximum amount of Hit Points a character has is easily represented by taking two dice of a value equal to the die value of the Characters Vitality. 
- For example, if a character has 3 ranks in Vitality, then that character represents their Hit Points with 2d6 set to their maximum value, 12 is the maximum Hit Points in this case. Subtracting hit points is done by decreasing the value on the dice.

Hit Points are reduced mainly when a character takes [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]]. This is generally avoided by consuming [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]].

## Dying
If a characters hit points would reach 0 hit points, the character suffers 1 rank of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition for every point of remaining [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] that would reduce the Characters hit points below 0. Characters cannot be below 0 [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Hit Points\|Hit Points]].

If a character reaches 0 ranks of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition, the character regains 1 hit point.

After a character has gained enough ranks of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition that the character will be made unconscious due to a lack of maximum [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]]. The dying character must now make Vitality+Will [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|ability checks]] at the end of their turn against the number of ranks of [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] to remain alive.

A dying and unconscious character that succeeds this ability check 3 times becomes stable. A stable character no longer has to make Vitality+Will [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|ability checks]] and will have all of their [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] removed after a [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Resting#Break\|Break]]. A dying and unconscious character that fails 3 times dies.

## Overkill
If a character were to drop to 0 hit points and have enough remaining damage to equal to twice the characters maximum hit points, that character would die instantly.
