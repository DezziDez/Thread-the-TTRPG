Stamina is the fuel and energy for every character. 

The maximum amount of Stamina a character has is easily represented by taking two dice of a value equal to the die value of the Characters Will. 
For example, if a character has 2 ranks in Will, then that character represents their Stamina with 2d4 set to their maximum value, 8 is the maximum Stamina in this case. Subtracting Stamina is done by decreasing the value on the dice.

Stamina is consumed whenever a character uses an action or takes [[Core Rules/Damage/Damage\|Damage]].

Stamina is reset back to its maximum value at the beginning of the character's turn and actions taken on any previous turn no longer effect the cost of actions made on the new turn.

## Actions and Rollover
Taking an [[Core Rules/Actions/Actions\|action]] consumes Stamina based on the action. 

The cost of subsequent actions increases by adding the prior action's base cost. This is known as Rollover.

For example, if a character performs an action that costs 3 Stamina points and then performs an action that costs 2 Stamina points, the second action will actually cost 5 Stamina points. 
If this character then carries out another action with a cost of 1 Stamina point, this third action would cost 3 Stamina points because the base cost of the prior actions is now 2 Stamina points.

### Continuous Costs
Certain actions may have ongoing or continuous Stamina costs. These types of actions provide constant benefits but come with a regular expense that is paid at the start of each of the character's turns.

The cost of these continuous effects is considered their first action and must be added to the Stamina cost of the next action taken by the character.

If a character is performing a continuous action, they may end that action at any time, including outside of their own turn, at no cost.

### Quick Actions
Some situations may require an immediate response from the characters, even outside of their turn. These are called quick actions. Performing a quick action requires twice as much Stamina as a regular action, including twice the base cost of the last action the character took.

Any action may be used as a quick action and it is encouraged for characters to be creative with how and when they spend their Stamina.

### Maximum Stamina
A character's maximum Stamina may be decreased due to certain circumstances or conditions. Should a character's maximum Stamina reach 0, that character suffers the unconscious condition.
