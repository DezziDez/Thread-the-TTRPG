All characters have a Disposition to all other characters, groups, or ideas. This represents how characters feel about the target of their emotions and can be used to represent a character's emotional state or personality when used liberally.

## Emotions
Disposition in its most basic form is represented as positive, neutral, and negative. However, often characters have more complex emotions or feelings about the target of their emotions. Loving, Caring, Friendly, Passive, Neutral, Uncaring, Frightened, Terrified, Disgusted, Dislike, Aggressive, Hostile, Hateful.

## Influence
These dispositions can greatly influence how a character feels about other characters, groups of people, and various ideologies or ideas. Dispositions can help flesh out a character's emotions and feelings.

A friendly disposition would cause a character might be convinced to help while an Aggressive character may be impossible to influence without changing their disposition or threat.

## Reason
Reasons for various dispositions are always there. Whether simple or complex. The character may not even be aware of the reasons for their disposition; buried deep in their minds.

A character may have had a bad experience when they were little with a certain animal or they might be grateful to a traveler that saved their life.

A reason for a character's disposition should always be known to the [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|Players]] or [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]]. If a character has no feelings one way or another, then a neutral disposition should be used until that disposition is changed.

## Writing
Writing a disposition is simple.
- Select a target for the Disposition. It could be a character, concept, idea, object, or anything.
- Select a feeling towards that target.
- Choose a reason for that feeling.
