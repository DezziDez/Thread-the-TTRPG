A turn timer is a tool that the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] can employ to speed up [[Core Rules/Events\|Events]] or to add tension to the game.

During a character's [[Core Rules/Turns\|turn]], a turn timer of 60 seconds may be used. Once this timer runs out of time, the character's turn ends immediately.

This time can be lengthened or shortened depending on the needs of the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]].
