A property describes the functions and basics of an [[Items\|Item]]. All [[Items\|Items]] have a basic property that describes the foundation of the [[Items\|Item]] and extra properties that add new functions to the item beyond the basic property.

## Natures
The nature of a property is what the property most resembles in the item itself, how it functions, and what flavor its given.

This Nature can be referenced in certain skills or other Properties.

The Nature of the [[Items\|Item]] is determined when the [[Items\|Item]] is [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Crafting\|Crafted]].
