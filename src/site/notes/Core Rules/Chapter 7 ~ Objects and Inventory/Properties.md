Properties describe how [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] function within the world and [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Setting\|Setting]] they are in. All Objects have Properties.
## Object Ranks
As an Object gains Properties it also gains [[Core Rules/Chapter 3 ~ The Basics/Ranks\|Ranks]]. Generally, Objects with higher Ranks are more effective than Objects with lower Ranks.

An Object has a number of Ranks for every Property it has.
## Synergies
Some Properties actively boost other properties or are only effective if it has a certain property. While there is no hard restriction on what properties an Object can have, there are soft restrictions within the properties themselves that may make combining them ineffective.
