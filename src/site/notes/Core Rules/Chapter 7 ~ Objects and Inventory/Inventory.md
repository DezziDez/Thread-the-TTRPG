[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] can store and hold [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] on themselves within their inventory. The inventory of a Character consists of two parts. Held and Stored. Each containing Slots.

It is generally assumed that Characters figure out a way to store items on themselves. 
## Slots
A Slot is the amount of [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Bulk\|Bulk]] that Character can carry in any one location.
## Held Objects
A Held Object is an Object that can be used immediately and is actively being held by the Character in whatever manner they have available to them.
## Stored Objects
A Stored Object is an object stored somewhere on the Character. Characters generally need some means to store objects such as clothing, bags, straps, or rope.
## Size Scaling
Characters can have many [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Sizes\|Sizes]] and as such, they can carry larger Objects or even other Characters.

The amount of Slots a Character has for Held Objects is doubled for every size.
