[[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] can store and hold [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] on themselves within their inventory. The inventory of a Character consists of two parts. Held and Stored. Each containing Slots.
It is generally assumed that Characters figure out a way to store items on themselves. 
## Slots
A Slot is the amount of [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Bulk\|Bulk]] that Character can carry in any one location.
## Held Objects
A Held Object is an Object that can be used immediately and is actively being held by the Character in whatever manner they have available to them.
## Stored Objects
A Stored Object is an object stored somewhere on the Character. Characters generally need some means to store objects such as clothing, bags, straps, or rope.
## Worn Objects
Some [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Characters]] may wish to wear things like Clothing or Armor. Such objects do not take up [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Inventory\|Inventory]] space but a Character can only wear such Objects within reason.

>[!Examples]
>A Character cannot wear two sets of Armor on top of each other.
>A Character can wear light clothing under armor but cannot wear heavy winter clothing under armor without serious modifications to the Armor or clothing.
>A Character cannot wear two sets of shoes, cloaks, or anything else that is unreasonable.
>A Character can wear multiple sets of clothing, such as two pairs of pants, though this may slow the Character.

>[!Worn vs Stored]
[[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] that are worn do not count as Stored Objects as the [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Bulk\|Bulk]] of the Object is evenly distributed over the Character. Only Objects being carried or of excessive Bulk, such as slinging a pair of boots over your shoulder, wearing a backpack, or wearing full plate armor, must be Stored.
## Size Scaling
Characters can have many [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Sizes\|Sizes]] and as such, they can carry larger Objects or even other Characters.
The amount of Slots a Character has for Held Objects is doubled for every size.
