All [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Objects]] in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Thread/What is Thread\|Thread]] have a primary material that they are made of. This material determines the [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Object Health\|Object Health]] and its [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Bulk\|Bulk]]. Materials can be broken down into a few groups.

| Material Category | Example                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Cloth             | Woven Wool, Woven Cotton, Woven Hemp |
| Metal             | Steel, Gold, Graphite                |
| Crystal           | Glass, Sapphire, Obsidian            |
| Animal            | Bones, Leather, Fur                  |
| Plant             | Wood, Vine, Paper                    |
These materials more describe the category of the material rather than the actual materials themselves. Plastics are more difficult to categorize as they can be similar to many different materials.
