Bulk is the amount of space and weight an [[Core Rules/Chapter 7 ~ Objects and Inventory/Objects\|Object]] or [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundations/Characters\|Character]] takes up. This depends on the [[Core Rules/Chapter 6 ~ Areas and Maps/Sizes\|Size]] of the Object or Character and their properties.

An Object or Character's size doubles in Bulk for every increase in size.

| Steps | Size   | Bulk |
| ----- | ------ | ---- |
| <0.5  | Minute | 0.25 |
| 0.5   | Tiny   | 0.5  |
| 1     | Small  | 1    |
| 2     | Medium | 4    |
| 3     | Large  | 8    |
| 4     | Huge   | 16   |
| ...   | ...    | ...  |
Minute items are considered to be negligible and are often ignored unless there are a large quantity of negligible items.
