Some [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] want to wear Armor. As long as the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] meets the requirement for that armor, it will go into that character's armor slot.

A character's armor [[Core Rules/Inventory/Slots\|Slot]] represents the character's entire body worth of armor. And a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] cannot wear more armor than is reasonable. An example being a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] wearing two sets of boots.
