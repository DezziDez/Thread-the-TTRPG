A slot is a unit of measurement to determine how much a character can hold. It represents the size and weight of the item in question.

A heavy item that is small may still take up 1 slot while a bulky item that is light will also take up 1 slot.

Items can take up slots as follows:

<0 slot sized: These items are so inconsequential that 6 count as a 0 slot item or 36 as a 1 slot item. Depending on the item, the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] may determine a Character can store more items than this amount.
0 slot sized: These items are negligible in size and/or weight. 6, 0 slot sized items takes up 1 slot.
1 slot sized: These items are of average size and/or weight and can easily be held in 1 hand.
2 slot sized: These items are above average in size and/or weight and requires 2 hands to be held.
3 slot sized: These items are extremely large and/or heavy. Giving 1 Rank of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] condition to any character carrying it.
4 slot sized: These items can only be lifted temporarily. A character lifting an item such as this has the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Immobilized\|Immobilized]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] if they do not have [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Help\|Help]] from another character.

### Size Changes
The amount of space an item takes up increases or decreases based on the [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|size]] of the Character.

As a character increases in [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|Sizes]] beyond Medium, the slot size of an item decreases by 1 for every size increase.
As a character decreases in [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|Sizes]] below Medium, the slot size of an item increases by 1 for every size decrease.
