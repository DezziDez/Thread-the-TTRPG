Accessory slots are the items not currently [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|Equipped]] by the character. Items stored in an accessory slot must become [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|Equipped]] before it can be used in any [[Core Rules/Actions/Actions\|Actions]].

The number of accessory slots a character has is dependent on their [[Core Rules/Inventory/Carrying Capacity\|Carrying Capacity]].
