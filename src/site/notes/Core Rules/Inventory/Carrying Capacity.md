All characters have a carrying capacity that determines the number of [[Core Rules/Inventory/Accessories\|accessory]] [[Core Rules/Inventory/Slots\|Slots]] a character can have.

A character can have a number of accessory slots equal to their number of [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Might. This does not affect Equipped item slots.

For example, if a character has 4 [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Might. Then they have 4 accessory slots and 2 [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|Equipped]] item slots.
