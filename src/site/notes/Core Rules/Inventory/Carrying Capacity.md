All [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] have a carrying capacity that determines the number of [[Core Rules/Inventory/Accessories\|accessory]] [[Core Rules/Inventory/Slots\|Slots]] a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can have.

A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can have a number of accessory [[Core Rules/Inventory/Slots\|Slots]] equal to their number of [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Might. This does not affect Equipped [[Core Rules/Items\|item]] slots.

For example, if a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has 4 [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Might. Then they have 4 accessory [[Core Rules/Inventory/Slots\|Slots]] and 2 [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|Equipped]] [[Core Rules/Items\|item]] slots.
