All characters can perform basic actions and [[Core Rules/Actions/Free Actions\|Free Actions]]. 
All basic actions cost 2 [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] points when used. 
## Step
When a character performs any action, unless otherwise specified, they are allowed to move 1 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Tiles\|tile]] in any direction they can access. This movement is called a step and can be taken before or after the action itself. Steps are not restricted by the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] condition unless the character's speed is 0.
