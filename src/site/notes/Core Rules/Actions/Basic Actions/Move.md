### Description
A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] moves through the terrain at their [[Core Rules/Positioning/Speed\|Speed]].

#### Using Move
- The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] moves a number of [[Core Rules/Positioning/Tiles\|Tiles]] up to their [[Core Rules/Positioning/Speed\|Speed]]. 
- If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] does not use the entirety of their [[Core Rules/Positioning/Speed\|Speed]] before using another [[Core Rules/Actions\|action]] or ending their [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Turns\|turn]], the remaining speed is lost and the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] must use the [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] again to use their speed.
- A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can inflict themselves with the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Prone\|Prone]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] while using Move. Doing so costs 2 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Tiles\|Tiles]] of speed.
- If the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can stand up, they may do so while using Move. Removing the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Prone\|Prone]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]]. Doing so costs 4 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Tiles\|Tiles]] of speed.

### Notes
A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] is allowed to use a [[Core Rules/Actions#Step\|Step]] before or after taking the move [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] as this does not count towards their speed.
