# Description
Prepare is a strategistic action that allows for better [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] management. It also helps with setup and planning outside of normal turns.

# When Used
- The player must declare their next quick action.
- The Stamina cost of the previous action is ignored.
- The character's turn ends.
- The Stamina cost of the next quick action is not doubled as long as it is the declared quick action.

# Notes
The cost of this action is always the base cost of a basic action. Ignoring the cost of the previous action.

The declared quick action is effectively the normal cost of the action plus the cost of the Prepare action.
