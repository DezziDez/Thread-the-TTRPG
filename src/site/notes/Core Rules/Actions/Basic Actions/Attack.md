#### Using Attack
A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] that takes the attack [[Core Rules/Actions\|action]] performs one of the following:
- The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] attacks with a [[Core Rules/Items/Properties/Basic Properties/Weapon\|weapon]] within [[Core Rules/Positioning/Range\|Range]]. Dealing [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] based on a roll of the [[Core Rules/Abilities\|Ability]] for the weapon plus the [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] die of the weapon.
	- For example: A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] with rank 3 Might using a Might weapon that had a d4 [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] die, would deal 1d6+1d4 [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]].
- The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] attacks without a weapon. All [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] can use Might to attack without a weapon. Dealing just the [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] die of their Might [[Core Rules/Abilities\|ability]].
	- For example: A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] with rank 3 Might attacking with their bare hands would deal 1d6 [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]].

#### Finish the Dying
Using the Attack [[Core Rules/Actions\|action]] on a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] with the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] and that attack would have reduced their [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Hit Points\|Hit Points]]. The number of ranks of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition are doubled.
