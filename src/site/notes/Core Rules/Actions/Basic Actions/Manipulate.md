### Description
Manipulation is used to use force to [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] objects or other [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]].

#### Using Manipulate
- A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] selects an object or [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] that is not more than 1 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|size]] larger than themselves to move. 
- The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] requires at least 1 free [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|Equipped]] [[Core Rules/Inventory/Slots\|Slot]] / hand.
- The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] makes a Might+Might check against the object or as a contest against the other character.
- Successfully moving the object or [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] moves them 1 tile in any direction.

### Notes
Using manipulate to [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] down can force a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] to become [[Core Rules/Conditions/Prone\|Prone]].
