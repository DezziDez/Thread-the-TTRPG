### Description
Manipulation is used to use force to move objects or other characters.

#### Using Manipulate
- A character selects an object or character that is not more than 1 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Sizes\|size]] larger than themselves to move. 
- The character requires at least 1 free [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|Equipped]] slot / hand.
- The character makes a Might+Might check against the object or as a contest against the other character.
- Successfully moving the object or character moves them 1 tile in any direction.

### Notes
Using manipulate to move a character down can force a character to become [[Core Rules/Conditions/Prone\|Prone]].
