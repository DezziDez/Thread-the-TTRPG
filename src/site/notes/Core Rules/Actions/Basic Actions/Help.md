### Description
A character can provide aid to a roll to make the roll more likely to succeed or be more effective instead of making more than one roll. 

#### Using help
- The character helps one other character with their next roll.
- The other character gains an advantage on that roll.
- A character cannot gain an advantage from the Help [[Core Rules/Actions\|action]] more than once in a roll.
- Using the Help [[Core Rules/Actions\|action]] on a character with the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition also removes 1 rank of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition from the character.

### Notes
Help can be given on any roll as long as the circumstances make sense and the character can actually help.
