Every character can perform 1 free action without any cost. A free action is a very quick and low-energy task.

Free actions are separate from all other actions. They ignore the cost of the previous action and do not affect the cost of the next action.

If a character wishes to perform more than 1 free action in a round, they must expend 1 [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] point for every extra free action to do so.


## Example Free Actions
- Equipping or Unequipping an item.
- Studying another Character to gain information.
- Taking a [[Core Rules/Actions/Actions#Step\|Step]]. (This also triggers a step allowing you to move 2 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Tiles\|tiles]] total)
- Using an item or object in the environment or that is equipped.
- Reloading a ranged weapon.
- A quick shout to another Character.
