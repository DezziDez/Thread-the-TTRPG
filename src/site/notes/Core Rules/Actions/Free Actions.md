Every [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can perform 1 free [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] without any cost. A free [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] is a very quick and low-energy task.

Free [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] are separate from all other [[Core Rules/Actions\|actions]]. They ignore the cost of the previous [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] and do not affect the cost of the next action.

If a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] wishes to perform more than 1 free [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] in a round, they must expend 1 [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Stamina\|Stamina]] point for every extra free [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] to do so.


## Example Free Actions
- [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|Equipping]] or Unequipping an [[Core Rules/Items\|Item]].
- Studying another [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] to gain information.
- Taking a [[Core Rules/Actions#Step\|Step]]. (This also triggers a step allowing you to move 2 [[Core Rules/Positioning/Tiles\|tiles]] total)
- Using an [[Core Rules/Items\|item]] or object in the environment or that is [[Core Rules/Inventory/Equipped\|equipped]].
- Reloading a ranged [[Core Rules/Items/Properties/Basic Properties/Weapon\|weapon]].
- A quick shout to another Character.
