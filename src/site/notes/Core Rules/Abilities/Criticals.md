A critical or crit is an extreme of high or lows that drives tension and adds potential swingy-ness to a game.

## Critical Success
A critical success is when an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|ability check]] or an [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] is made and both dice land on their maximum value. When this happens, the total roll is doubled, potentially making the roll a success or dealing twice as much [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] if that roll was an [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]].

Some additional event may occur due to a critical success based on the situation. This is known as a brutal critical success and it is up to the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] to determine the outcome of the great success.


## Critical Failure
A critical failure is when an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|ability check]] or an [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] is made and both dice land on 1. When this happens the check automatically fails and no [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]] is dealt if that roll was an [[Core Rules/Actions/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]].

Some additional event may occur due to a critical failure based on the situation. This is known as a brutal critical fail and it is up to the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] to determine the outcome of the great failure.

## Advantages and Disadvantages with Criticals
Characters can gain [[Core Rules/Abilities/Advantage and Disadvantage\|advantages or disadvantages]] from certain skills, conditions, or situations, affecting their rolls. If two of these, either advantages or disadvantages, force a critical roll in either direction, the critical should not be counted. 

Example 1: If a character has two disadvantages, they would have two guaranteed natural 1s. In this case, the occurrence of two critical failures wouldn't happen. Same goes for advantages and a critical success. 

Example 2: If a character has one disadvantage, they will have one guaranteed natural 1. This would result in a critical failure if another natural 1 appears on their other die roll. The same applies to advantages and a critical success
