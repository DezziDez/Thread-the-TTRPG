Some ability checks may need to be done repetitively over time. Such as continuously watching for traps or reading another creatures emotions during a conversation.

This is when a Character would use their Average Check. This is an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|Ability Check]] that does not require a roll. The average of the check would be used. Which is half of the die rounded up to the nearest whole number. The average can also be found on the [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] table.

For example, if a character has 3 [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Insight and 2 [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Intellect, and wanted to detect if a Character is lying during an interrogation repetitively, they would use the average of 4+3=7 instead of rolling.

If a character has an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Advantage and Disadvantage\|Advantage]] or [[Core Rules/Abilities/Advantage and Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] they would simply move that die to it's maximum or minimum respectively instead of taking the average.

For the same example, if the character has an advantage, they would use 4+4=8 instead of 7. If the character has a disadvantage, they would use 4+1=5 instead of 7.
