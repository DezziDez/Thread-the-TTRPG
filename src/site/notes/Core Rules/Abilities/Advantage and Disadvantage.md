A character may gain an advantage or suffer a disadvantage in certain situations or through certain skills.
### Advantage
When a character has advantage on a roll, they choose the smallest die of that roll and set its value to the highest possible number. For example, if a character rolls 1d8 and 1d4, they would roll 1d8 and add 4 instead of rolling the 1d4. If there are two advantages, both dice are set to their maximum values.
### Disadvantage
If a character has disadvantage on a roll, they choose the smallest die of that roll and set its value to 1. For example, if a character rolls 1d8 and 1d4, they would roll 1d8 and add 1 instead of rolling the 1d4. If there are two disadvantages, both dice are set to 1.
#### Both
When a character has both an advantage and a disadvantage on a roll, they cancel each other out. However, more advantages or disadvantages can still be applied afterwards.
