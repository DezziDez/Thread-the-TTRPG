[[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] are generally a form of contest, either with another [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] or the environment.

A contest with another [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] involves two [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] making [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]]. For instance, 1 [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] might roll Insight+Intellect to detect if another person is lying, while the opposing [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] rolls Insight+Will to maintain their deception.

Contests with the environment are much more common. In contests with the environment, the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] determines a difficulty level or [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] of the contest and rolls dice accordingly. The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] must now compete against the result of the roll. Difficulty levels range from Trivial to Extreme. If a more solid number is desired, the average of the rolls can be used.
