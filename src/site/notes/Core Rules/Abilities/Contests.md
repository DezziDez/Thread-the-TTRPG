[[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]] are generally a form of contest, either with another character or the environment.

A contest with another character involves two characters making [[Core Rules/Abilities/Ability Checks\|Ability Checks]], For instance, 1 character might roll Insight+Intellect to detect if another person is lying, while the opposing character rolls Insight+Will to maintain their deception.

Contests with the environment are much more common. In contests with the environment, the GM determines a difficulty level or [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] of the contest and rolls dice accordingly. The character must now compete against the result of the roll. Difficulty levels range from Trivial to Extreme. If a more solid number is desired, the average of the rolls can be used.
