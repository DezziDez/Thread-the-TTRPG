### Description
A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can provide aid to a roll to make the roll more likely to succeed or be more effective instead of making more than one roll. 

#### Using help
- The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] helps one other [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] with their next roll.
- The other [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] gains an Boon on that roll.
- A [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] cannot gain an Boon from the Help [[Core Rules/Actions\|action]] more than once in a roll.
- Using the Help [[Core Rules/Actions\|action]] on a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] with the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition also removes 1 rank of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Dying\|Dying]] condition from the character.

### Notes
Help can be given on any roll as long as the circumstances make sense and the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can actually help.
