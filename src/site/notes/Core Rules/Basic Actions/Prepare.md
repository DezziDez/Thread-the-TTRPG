### Description
Prepare is a strategistic [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] that allows for better [[Core Rules/Stamina\|Stamina]] management. It also helps with setup and planning outside of normal turns.

#### When Used
- The player must declare their next quick action.
- The Stamina cost of the previous [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] is ignored.
- The character's turn ends.
- The Stamina cost of the next quick [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] is not doubled as long as it is the declared quick action.

### Notes
The cost of this [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] is always the base cost of a basic action. Ignoring the cost of the previous action.

The declared quick [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] is effectively the normal cost of the [[Core Rules/Actions\|Action]] plus the cost of the Prepare action.
