Refresh: None

Effects:
You do not need to draw a line between you and another [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] to gain [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Flanking\|Flanking]]. You have [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Flanking\|Flanking]] as long as you are both within 1 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|tile]] of the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] you are both against.
