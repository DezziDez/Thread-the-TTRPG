Refresh: None

Effects:
Whenever you take the [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Action]] without a [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Item Property Lists/Basic Properties/Weapon\|Weapon]] you may add your Will [[TTRPG Basics/Dice\|Die]] to your [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]]. The resulting [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Attack\|Attack]] would be Will+Might instead of just Might.
