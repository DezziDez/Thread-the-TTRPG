Effects:
You gain access to the Charge [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|action]].

###### Charge (Stamina Cost: 4)
You can [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] up to your [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character Sheet/Speed\|Speed]] in a straight line. 

If you were to collide with another [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] that is no more than 1 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Sizes\|size]] larger than you, you deal [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] equal to 1 roll of your Might and stop moving. 

Additionally, the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] hit with your Charge is moved 1 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|tile]] for every 2 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|Tiles]] you moved in the same direction.
