In [[Thread\|Thread]], there is a concept known as Turn Time. This is where most crucial time-sensitive [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] occur. Turn Time can be entered at any time by the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] declaring an [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Events\|event]].

When an [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Events\|event]] is declared time slows into [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Turns\|Turns]] and [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Rounds\|Rounds]]. All [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] in the [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Events\|event]] must roll [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Initiative\|Initiative]]. The [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] with the highest initiative roll is the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] that goes first. After that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] ends their turn, the person controlling that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] chooses which [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] goes next.

This continues until all [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] have had a turn. 

Once the last [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] of the round finishes their turn, the beginning of the next round starts, and the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] with the highest initiative starts their turn.
