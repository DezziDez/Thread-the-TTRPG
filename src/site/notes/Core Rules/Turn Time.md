In Thread, there is a concept known as Turn Time. This is where most crucial time-sensitive actions occur. Turn Time can be entered at any time by the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] declaring an [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Events\|event]].

When an [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Events\|event]] is declared time slows into [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Turns\|Turns]] and [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Rounds\|Rounds]]. All characters in the [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Events\|event]] must roll [[Core Rules/Turn Time/Initiative\|Initiative]]. The Character with the highest initiative roll is the Character that goes first. After that character ends their turn, the person controlling that Character chooses which character goes next.

This continues until all Character have had a turn. 

Once the last Character of the round finishes their turn, the beginning of the next round starts, and the Character with the highest initiative starts their turn.
