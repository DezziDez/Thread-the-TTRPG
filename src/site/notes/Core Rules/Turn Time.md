In [[Thread\|Thread]], there is a concept known as Turn Time. This is where most crucial time-sensitive [[Core Rules/Actions\|Actions]] occur. Turn Time can be entered at any time by the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] declaring an [[Core Rules/Events\|event]].

When an [[Core Rules/Events\|event]] is declared time slows into [[Core Rules/Turns\|Turns]] and [[Core Rules/Rounds\|Rounds]]. All [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|Players]] vote to decide which [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] goes first. After that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] ends their turn, the [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|player]] or [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] controlling that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] chooses which [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] goes next.

This continues until all [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] in the [[Core Rules/Events\|event]] have had a turn. 

Once the last [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] of the [[Core Rules/Rounds\|round]] finishes their turn, the beginning of the next round starts, and all [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|Players]] vote on the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] that goes first on the new [[Core Rules/Rounds\|round]].

### Hidden Characters
If there are characters in an [[Core Rules/Events\|event]] that the [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|Players]] are not aware of or is hidden, then the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] may choose for one of those [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|characters]] to go first instead of the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] the [[TTRPG Basics/Players\|Players]] vote on if a vote takes place.
