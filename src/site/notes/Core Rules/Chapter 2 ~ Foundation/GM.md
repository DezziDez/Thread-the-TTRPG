GM or Game Master is the one who sets everything up. They make choices for the setting, the game, [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/NPC\|NPCs]], and any other choice that isn't made by [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Players\|Players]].

The [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] is a practically the most important role in [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Threads/Thread\|Thread]] because without a [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] the game cannot exist.

The [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] makes all the final choices, including and definitely not limited to, what rules to use, what rules not to use, and if a rule should be changed or not. In [[Core Rules/Chapter 1 ~ Threads/Thread\|Thread]] there are no hard and fast rules. Instead, this system is built on a foundation of trust and respect between the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/GM\|GM]] and the [[Core Rules/Chapter 2 ~ Foundation/Players\|Players]] to make the most fun game that can be made.
