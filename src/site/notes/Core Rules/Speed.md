All [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Characters]] have a speed stat that determines how far that [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can [[Core Rules/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] on solid ground.

A character's speed is determined by adding together their ranks in Agility and Might together. Then doubling it.
- For example, if a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has 2 [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Agility and 3 [[Core Rules/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Might, the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] has 2+3=5, 5+5=10 speed. That [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] can then [[Core Rules/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] 10 [[Core Rules/Tiles\|Tiles]] when they used the [[Core Rules/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] action.

Whenever a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] wants to [[Core Rules/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] through a more difficult environment such as swimming, climbing, or moving through bramble. That [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] suffers 1 rank of the [[Core Rules/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] [[Core Rules/Conditions\|condition]] until the [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] stops moving.
