## What are Skills
Skills are the main access to power and ability in Thread. Instead of having a standard set way of play, Thread offers the ability to mix and match skills to make unique characters of any kind.

## Purchasing Skills
Whenever a [[TTRPG Basics/Character\|Character]] spends [[Core Rules/Ranks/Rank Points\|Rank Points]] during a [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Resting#Full-Rest\|Full-Rest]] they may purchase a skill instead of increase the [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] of [[Core Rules/Abilities/Abilities\|Abilities]].

Every skill is associated with an [[Core Rules/Abilities/Abilities\|ability]]. When a character wishes to purchase a skill they must have a number of [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] in the associated [[Core Rules/Abilities/Abilities\|ability]] to equal the rank of the skill that Character wishes to take.

For example, if a character wishes to purchase a Rank 3 skill in Agility, that character must first have at least 3 [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] in the Agility [[Core Rules/Abilities/Abilities\|ability]].

The character must then spend a number of [[Core Rules/Ranks/Rank Points\|Rank Points]] equal to the Rank of the skill plus the number of skills the character has in that [[Core Rules/Abilities/Abilities\|ability]].

For example, if a character has 3 skills and wishes to purchase a rank 2 skill. They must spend 5 [[Core Rules/Ranks/Rank Points\|Rank Points]] to purchase it.

## Requirements
Some skills have requirements, usually other skills, before that skill can be taken. These skills are marked with their requirements at the top of their description.

## Refresh
Some skills can only be used a certain number of times before they need to be refreshed. The skill will describe the conditions for a refresh but this is usually performed during [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Resting\|Resting]].

A skill may have a variable number of uses before a refresh. These are usually based on the number of ranks of the associated [[Core Rules/Abilities/Abilities\|ability]] and a multiplier.

For example, 2xMight / [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Resting#Break\|Break]] would be 2 times the number of [[Core Rules/Ranks/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Might of the character for every [[Core Rules/Character Sheet/Resting#Break\|Break]].
