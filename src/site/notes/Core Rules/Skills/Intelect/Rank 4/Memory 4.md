Effects:
You can recall extremely faint information even if you never actively learned it. Such as whispered rumors, a footnote of a footnote, a glanced-at sign, and a stain on someone's clothes.

In addition, you can tell if someone else is remembering something incorrectly, is uncertain, or is attempting to gaslight. Even if you do not know the information.
