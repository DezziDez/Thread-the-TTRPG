Requirements: [[Core Rules/Skills/Intelect/Rank 5/Memory 5\|Memory 5]]
Refresh: None

Effects:

You can piece together extremely vague information and little details to come to conclusions that are impossible for others to come to.

These details may not be obvious at first and it takes time to work through the vast amount of information. But you will always come to the correct conclusion.

Explaining a conclusion from your information is extremely difficult and requires an Intellect+Insight [[Core Rules/Ability Checks\|ability check]] to do so.

The information you can unravel can be as simple as, "Who is the murderer?" to, vast secrets of the universe.
