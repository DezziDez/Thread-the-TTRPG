#### Fall Damage
If a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] falls more than 1 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|Tile]] then that [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] would take [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage Types/Physical\|Physical]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] equal to twice the number of [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|Tiles]] they fell.

#### Hang Time
If a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] were to fall outside of their turn, they do not fall until after the beginning of their [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Turns\|Turn]]. The [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] has 1 [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Actions\|Action]] to prevent themselves from falling.
If that [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] cannot prevent themselves from falling, they fall 100 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|Tiles]] and can continue with the rest of their [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Turns\|Turn]]. If the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] is still falling by the end of their [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Turns\|Turn]], they fall 400 [[Core Rules/Environment and Location/Tiles\|Tiles]].
