[[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] can take cover behind objects to protect themselves. The cover itself though can take the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Damage\|Damage]] and once the cover is destroyed the protection is gone.

#### Full Cover
The [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] is sufficiently covered to not be targeted or directly seen within line of sight.
Areas of Effect that do not [[Core Rules/Actions and Turn Time/Basic Actions/Move\|Move]] around corners cannot hit the Character.

#### Half Cover
At least half of the [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] is covered
[[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Characters]] targeting the partially covered [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] suffer a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Boon and Bane\|Bane]].
