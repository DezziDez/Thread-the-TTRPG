There are many types of light, but the light types that will be encountered most often by any [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] are as follows from brightest to darkest:

##### Blinding
This type of light is so bright that it is blinding. Blinding light inflicts the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Blinded\|Blinded]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]] on any [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] that is within its radius. This type of light is usually brief and only blinds [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] temporarily.

##### Bright
Bright light is extremely clear light that fills large areas and adds contrast, such as sunlight. [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] seeing through bright light gain a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] on vision based ability checks.

##### Normal
Normal lighting is the average amount of light any [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] would experience inside a building with light sources or natural lighting from windows.

##### Low
Low lighting is difficult to see in, there is some light but not much. [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] suffer a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Boon and Bane\|Bane]] to vision based ability checks while trying to see through it.

##### Darkness
There is absolutely no light here. [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] attempting to see through darkness suffer the [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Condition List/Blinded\|Blinded]] [[Core Rules/Damage and Conditions/Conditions\|condition]].
