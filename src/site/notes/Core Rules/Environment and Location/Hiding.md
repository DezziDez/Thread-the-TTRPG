If a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] cannot be seen and another [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] is not aware of where they are, then that [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] is considered Hidden from the other character.

If another [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] is Hidden, then as long as the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] remains hidden, then the [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] that is not aware of the Hidden [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] cannot local them without actively searching.

Additionally, A Hidden [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Character]] has a [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Boon and Bane\|Boon]] against other [[Core Rules/Character and Contests/Character\|Characters]] not aware of them.
