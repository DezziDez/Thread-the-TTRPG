A [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Slots\|Slot]] is a unit of measurement to determine how much a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] can hold. It represents the size and weight of the [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|item]] in question.

A heavy [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|item]] that is small may still take up 1 [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Slots\|Slot]] while a bulky [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|item]] that is light will also take up 1 slot.

[[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Items]] can take up [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Slots\|Slots]] as follows:

<0 [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Slots\|Slot]] sized: These [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Items]] are so inconsequential that 6 count as a 0 [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Slots\|Slot]] [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|item]] or 36 as a 1 [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Inventory and Carry Capacity/Slots\|Slot]] [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Item]]. Depending on the [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Item]], the [[TTRPG Basics/GM\|GM]] may determine a [[Core Rules/Characters and Rolling/Character\|Character]] can store more [[Core Rules/Items, Crafting, Inventory/Items\|Items]] than this amount.
