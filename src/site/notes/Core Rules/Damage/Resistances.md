Some [[Core Rules/Skills\|Skills]] or [[Core Rules/Items\|Items]] provide protection against certain kinds of [[Core Rules/Damage\|Damage]]. For instance, Armor aids in resisting [[Core Rules/Damage/Types/Physical\|Physical]] Damage. The level of protection provided by the source is determined by its [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]]. When a character takes Damage they have a resistance to, they roll 1 die, according to the [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]], and subtract the rolled amount from the Damage taken.

If a character possesses multiple sources of resistance to a specific type of Damage, the [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] of protection increases by 1 from the highest ranking source. For example, a [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] 2 and a [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] 3 Resistance source would result in a [[Core Rules/Ranks\|rank]] 4 Resistance.
